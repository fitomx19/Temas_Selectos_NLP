david graham phillip a tribut even now i can not realiz that he is dead , and often in the citi street -- on fifth avenu in particular -- i find myself glanc ahead for a glimps of the tall , boyish , familiar figur -- experi onc again a flash of the old happi expect . i have live in mani land , and have known men . i never knew a finer man than graham phillip . his were the clearest , bluest , most honest eye i ever saw -- eye that scorn untruth -- eye that penetr all sham . in repos his handsom featur were a trifl stern -- and the magic of his smile was the more wonder -- such a sunni , youth , engag smile . his mere presenc in a room was exhilar . it seem to freshen the veri air with a keen sweet almost pungent . he was tall , spare , leisur , iron-strong ; yet figur , featur and bear were delight boyish . men like him , women like him when he like them . he was the most honest man i ever knew , clean in mind , clean-cut in bodi , a littl over-seri perhap , except when among intim ; a littl prone to hoist the burden of the world on his young shoulder . his was a knight mind ; a paladin charact . but he could unbend , and the memori of such hour with him -- hour that can never be again -- hurt more keen than the memori of calmer and more sober moment . we agre in mani matter , he and i ; in mani we differ . to me it was a greater honor to differ in opinion with such a man than to find an entir synod of my own mind . becaus -- and of cours this is the opinion of one man and worth no more than that -- i have alway thought that graham phillip was head and shoulder abov us all in his profess . he was to have been realli great . he is -- by his last book , '' susan lenox . '' not that , when he sometim discuss the write of it with me , i was in sympathi with it . i was not . we alway were truth to each other . but when a giant mold a lump of clay into tremend mass , lesser men becom confus by the huge contour , the vast distanc , the terrif space , the majest scope of the ensembl . so i . but he went on about his busi . i do not know what the public may think of `` susan lenox . '' i scarc know what i think . it is a terribl book -- terribl and true and beauti . under the depth there are unspeak thing that writh . his plumb-lin touch them and they squirm . he bend his head from the cloud to do it . is it worth do ? i do n't know . but this i do know -- that within the rang of all fiction of all land and of all time no charact has so overwhelm me as the charact of susan lenox . she is as real as life and as unreal . she is life . her was the concentr nobil of heaven and hell . and the divin of the one and the tragedi of the other . for she had known both -- this girl -- the most pathet , the most human , the most honest charact ever drawn by an american writer . in the presenc of his last work , so overwhelm , so stupend , we lesser men are left at a loss . it magnitud demand the perspect that time onli can lend it . it digniti and auster and it pitiless truth impos upon us that honest and intellig silenc which even the quickest mind conced is necessari befor an honest verdict . truth was his goddess ; he wrought honest and onli for her . he is dead , but he is to have his day in court . and whatev the verdict , if it be a true one , were he live he would rest content . robert w. chamber . befor the curtain a few year ago , as to the most import and most interest subject in the world , the relat of the sex , an author had to choos between silenc and tell those distort truth besid which plain lie seem almost white and quit harmless . and as no author could afford to be silent on the subject that under all subject , our literatur , in so far as it attempt to deal with the most vital phase of human natur , was beneath contempt . the author who knew they were lie sank almost as low as the nasty-nic purveyor of fake ideal and candi prurienc who fanci they were write the truth . now it almost seem that the day of lie conscious and unconsci is about run . `` and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . '' there are three way of deal with the sex relat of men and women -- two wrong and one right . for lack of more accur name the two wrong way may be call respect the anglo-saxon and the continent . both are in essenc process of spice up and color up perfect innocu fact of natur to make them poison attract to pervert palat . the wishy-washi literatur and the wishy-washi moral on which it is base are not one stage more -- or less -- rotten than the libertin literatur and the libertin moral on which it is base . so far as degrad effect is concern , the `` pure , sweet '' stori or play , fals to natur , fals to true moral , propagandist of indec emot disguis as ideal , need yield noth to the so-cal `` strong '' stori . both pander to differ form of the same diseas crave for the unnatur . both produc moral atrophi . the one tend to encourag the shallow and unthink in ignor of life and so caus them to suffer the merciless penalti of ignor . the other tend to miseduc the shallow and unthink , to give them a ruinous fals notion of the delight of vice . the anglo-saxon `` moral '' is like a nude figur salaci drape ; the continent `` strength '' is like a nude figur salaci distort . the anglo-saxon articl reek the stench of disinfect ; the continent reek the stench of degener perfum . the continent shout `` hypocrisi ! '' at the anglo-saxon ; the anglo-saxon shout `` filthi ! '' at the continent . both are right ; they are twin sister of the same horrid mother . and an author of either allegi has to have mani a redeem grace of style , of charact draw , of philosophi , to gain him toler in a clean mind . there is the third and right way of deal with the sex relat of men and women . that is the way of simpl candor and natur . treat the sex question as you would ani other question . do n't treat it rever ; do n't treat it rakish . treat it natur . do n't insult your intellig and lower your moral tone by think about either the decenc or the indec of matter that are familiar , undeni , and unchang fact of life . do n't look on woman as mere femal , but as human be . rememb that she has a mind and a heart as well as a bodi . in a sentenc , do n't join in the prurient clamor of `` puriti '' hypocrit and `` strong '' libertin that exagger and distort the most commonplac , if the most import featur of life . let us tri to be as sensibl about sex as we are tri to be about all the other phenomena of the univers in this more enlighten day . noth so sweeten a sin or so delight a sinner as get big-ey about it and him . those of us who are naughti aren't near so naughti as we like to think ; nor are those of us who are nice near so nice . our virtu and our fail are -- perhap to an unsuspect degre -- the result of the circumst in which we are place . the way to improv individu is to improv these circumst ; and the way to start at improv the circumst is by look honest and fearless at thing as they are . we must know our world and ourselv befor we can know what should be kept and what chang . and the begin of this wisdom is in see sex relat ration . until that fundament matter is brought under the sway of good common sens , improv in other direct will be slow inde . let us stop lie -- to other -- to ourselv . d.g.p . juli , 1908 . susan lenox chapter i '' the child 's dead , '' said nora , the nurs . it was the upstair sitting-room in one of the pretenti hous of sutherland , oldest and most charm of the town on the indiana bank of the ohio . the two big window were open ; their limp and listless draperi show that there was not the least motion in the stifl humid air of the juli afternoon . at the center of the room stood an oblong tabl ; over it were neat spread sever thick of white cotton cloth ; nake upon them lay the bodi of a newborn girl babi . at one side of the tabl nearer the window stood nora . her were the hard featur and corrug skin popular regard as the result of a life of toil , but in fact the result of a life of defianc to the law of health . as addit penalti for that same self-indulg she had an enorm bust and hip , thin face and arm , hollow , sinew-strip neck . the young man , blond and smooth face , at the other side of the tabl and face the light , was doctor steven , a recent graduat pupil of the famous schulz of saint christoph who as much as ani other one man is respons for the reject of hocus-pocus and the inject of common sens into american medicin . for upward of an hour young steven , coat off and shirt sleev roll to his shoulder , had been toil with the lifeless form on the tabl . he had tri everyth his train , his read and his experi suggest -- all the more or less familiar devic similar to those indic for case of drown . nora had watch him , at first with interest and hope , then with interest alon , final with swift deepen disapprov , as her compress lip and angri eye plain reveal . it seem to her his effort was degener into sacrileg , into defianc of an obvious decre of the almighti . howev , she had not ventur to speak until the young man , with a mutter ejacul suspici like an imprec , straighten his stocki figur and began to mop the sweat from his face , hand and bare arm . when she saw that her verdict had not been heard , she repeat it more emphat . `` the child 's dead , '' said she , `` as i told you from the set-out . '' she made the sign of the cross on her forehead and bosom , while her fat , dri lip move in a `` hail , mari . '' the young man did not rous from his reveri . he continu to gaze with a baffl express at the tini form , so like a whimsic caricatur of human . he show that he had heard the woman 's remark by say , to himself rather than to her , '' dead ? what 's that ? mere anoth name for ignor . '' but the current of his thought did not swerv . it held to the one cours : what would his master , the dauntless , the infinit resourc schulz , do if he were confront by this intoler obstacl of a perfect machin refus to do it duti and pump vital forc through an eager wait bodi ? `` he 'd _make_ it go , i 'd bet my life , '' the young man mutter . `` i 'm asham of myself . '' as if the reproach were just the spur his courag and his intellig had need , his face sudden glow with the upshoot fire of an inspir . he thrust the big white handkerchief into his hip pocket , laid one larg strong hand upon the small , beauti arch chest of the babi . nora , rous by his express even more than by his gestur , gave an exclam of horror . `` do n't touch it again , '' she cri , between entreati and command . `` you ve done all you can -- and more . '' steven was not listen . `` such a fine babi , too , '' he said , hesit -- the old woman mistaken fanci it was her word that made him paus . `` i feel no good at all , '' he went on , as if reason with himself , `` no good at all , lose both the mother and the child . '' `` _she_ did n't want to live , '' repli nora . her glanc stole somewhat fear toward the door of the adjoin room -- the bedroom where the mother lay dead . `` there was n't noth but disgrac ahead for both of them . everybodi ll be glad . '' `` such a fine babi , '' mutter the abstract young doctor . `` love-children alway is , '' said nora . she was look sad and tender down at the tini , symmetr form -- symmetr to her and the doctor 's expert eye . `` such a deep chest , '' she sigh . `` such pretti hand and feet . a real love-child . '' there she glanc nervous at the doctor ; it was meet and proper and pious to speak well of the dead , but she felt she might be go rather far for a `` good woman . '' `` i ll tri it , '' cri the young man in a resolut tone . `` it can't do ani harm , and -- -- '' without finish his sentenc he laid hold of the bodi by the ankl , swung it clear of the tabl . as nora saw it dangl head downward like a dress suckl pig on a butcher 's hook she vent a scream and dart round the tabl to stop by main forc this revolt desecr of the dead . steven call out stern : `` mind your busi , nora ! push the tabl against the wall and get out of the way . i want all the room there is . '' `` oh , doctor -- for the bless jesus ' sake -- -- '' '' push back that tabl ! '' nora shrank befor his fierc eye . she thought his exert , his disappoint and the heat had combin to toppl him over into insan . she retreat toward the farther of the open window . with a curs at her stupid steven kick over the tabl , use his foot vigor in thrust it to the wall . `` now ! '' exclaim he , take his stand in the center of the room and gaug the distanc of ceil , floor and wall . nora , her back against the window frame , her finger sunk in her big loos bosom , stare petrifi . steven , like an athlet swing an indian club , whirl the bodi round and round his head , at the full length of his power arm . more and more rapid he swung it , until his breath came and went in gasp and the sweat was trickl in stream down his face and neck . round and round between ceil and floor whirl the nake bodi of the babi -- round and round for minut that seem hour to the horrifi nurs -- round and round with all the strength and speed the young man could put forth -- round and round until the room was a blur befor his throb eye , until his express becam fulli as demoniac as nora had been fanci it . just as she was recov from her paralysi of horror and was about to fli shriek from the room she was halt by a sound that made her draw in air until her bosom swell as if it would burst it gingham prison . she crane eager toward steven . he was whirl the bodi more furious than ever . `` was that you ? '' ask nora hoars . `` or was it -- -- '' she paus , listen . the sound came again -- the sound of a drown person fight for breath . `` it 's -- it 's -- -- '' mutter nora . `` what is it , doctor ? '' `` life ! '' pant steven , triumph in his glisten , stream face . `` life ! '' he continu to whirl the littl form , but not so rapid or so vigor . and now the sound was louder , or , rather , less faint , less uncertain -- was a cri -- was the cri of a live thing . `` she 's aliv -- aliv ! '' shriek the woman , and in time with his movement she sway to and fro from side to side , laugh , weep , wring her hand , pat her bosom , her cheek . she stretch out her arm . `` my prayer are answer !

'' the unheed doctor kept on whirl until the cri was continu , a low but lusti wail of angri protest . then he stop , caught the babi up in both arm , burst out laugh . `` you littl minx ! '' he said -- or , rather , gasp -- a tender quit matern in his eye . `` but i got you ! nora , the tabl . '' nora right the tabl , spread and smooth the cloth , extend her scrawni eager arm for the babi . steven with a jerk of the head motion her asid , laid the babi on the tabl . he felt for the puls at it wrist , bent to listen at the heart . quit useless . that strong , rise howl of helpless furi was proof enough . her majesti the babi was mad through and through -- therefor aliv through and through . `` grand heart action !

'' but lorella lenox was forev tranquil in the sleep that engulf her and the sorrow in which she had been entangl by an impetu , trust heart . the apparit in the doorway was commonplac -- the mistress of the hous , lorella 's elder and marri sister fanni -- neither fair nor dark , neither tall nor short , neither thin nor fat , neither pretti nor home , neither stupid nor bright , neither neat nor dowdi -- one of that multitud of excel , unobtrus human be who make the rest stretch in a world of agit -- and who respond to the impetus of circumst as unresist as cloud to wind . as the wail of the child smote upon fanni 's ear she lift her head , startl , and cri out sharpli , `` what 's that ? '' `` we ve save the babi , mrs. warham , '' repli the young doctor , beam on her through his glass . `` oh !

'' this touch ruth 's impuls generous heart and woman 's easi tear fill her eye ; her cousin 's remark was so pathet , the more pathet becaus it patho was absolut unconsci . ruth shot a piti glanc at susan , but the instant she saw the loveli of the featur upon which that express of unconsci lay like innoc upon a bed of rose , the piti vanish from her eye to be replac by a disfigur envi as hate as an evil emot can be at nineteen . susan still lack near a month of seventeen , but she seem older than ruth becaus her mind and her bodi had develop beyond her year -- or , perhap it would be more accur to say beyond the averag of growth at seventeen . also , her person was stronger , far more definit . ruth tri to believ herself the clever and the more beauti , at time with a certain success . but as she happen to be a shrewd young person -- an inherit from the warham -- she was haunt by misgiv -- and wors . those whose vaniti never suffer from these torment will , of cours , condemn her ; but whoever has known the pain of have to conced superior to someon with whom she or he -- is constant contrast will not be altogeth without sympathi for ruth in her struggl , often vain struggl , against the mortal sin of jealousi . the truth is , susan was beyond question the beauti of sutherland . her eye , veri dark at birth , had chang to a soft , dreami violet-gray . hair and color , lash and eyebrow remain dark ; thus her eye and the intens red of her lip had that vicinag of contrast which is necessari to distinct . to look at her was to be at onc fascin by those violet-gray eye -- by their color , by their clear , by their regard of calm , grave inquiri , by their mysteri not untouch by a certain sad . she had a thick abund of wavi hair , not so long as ruth 's golden braid , but grow beauti instead of thin about her low brow , about her delic model ear , and at the back of her exquisit neck . her slim nose depart enough from the classic line to prevent the suggest of monotoni that is in all pure classic face . her nostril had the sensit that more than ani other outward sign indic the imagin tempera . her chin and throat -- to look at them was to know where her lover would choos to kiss her first . when she smile her larg even teeth were dazzl . and the smile itself was exceed sweet and win , with the violet-gray eye cast over it that serious verg on sad which is the natur outlook of a high intellig natur . for while stupid vain peopl are suspici and easili offend , onli the intellig are truli sensit -- keen suscept to all sensat . the dull ear is suspici ; the acut ear is sensit . the intens red of her lip , at time so vivid that it seem artifici , and their sinuous , sensit curv indic a tempera that was frank proclaim in her figur -- sensuous , grace , slender -- the figur of girlhood in it perfect and of perfect womanhood , too -- like those tropic flower that look innoc and young and fresh , yet stir in the behold passion long and vision . her walk was worthi of face and figur -- free and firm and grace , the small head carri proud without haughti . this physic beauti had as an aureol to illumin it and to set it off a manner that was wholli devoid of manner -- of those that men and women think out and exhibit to give ad charm to themselv -- trick of cute , as lisp and babi stare ; trick of digniti , as grave brow and bodi alway carri rigid erect ; trick of sweet and kindli , as the ever readi smile and the warm handclasp . susan , the interest in the world about her , susan , the self-unconsci , had none of these trick . she was at all time her own self . beauti is anyth but rare , likewis intellig . but this qualiti of natur is the greatest of all qualiti . it made susan lenox uniqu . it was not strang -- nor inexcus that the girl and their parent had begun to piti susan as soon as this beauti develop and this person had begun to exhal it delici perfum . it was but natur that they should start the whole town to '' be kind to the poor thing . '' and it was equal the matter of cours that they should have achiev their object -- should have impress the convent masculin mind of the town with such a sens of the `` poor thing 's '' social isol and '' imposs '' that the boy ceas to be her eager admir friend , were afraid to be alon with her , to ask her to danc . women are convent as a busi ; but with men convent is a grovel superstit . the youth of sutherland long for , sigh for the allur , sweet , bright susan ; but they dare not , with all the women say `` poor thing ! what a piti a nice man ca n't afford to have anyth to do with her ! '' it was an interest typic exampl of the profound snobbish of the male charact . rare , after susan was sixteen , did ani of the boy ventur to ask her to danc and so give himself the joy of encircl that love form of her ; yet from babyhood her fascin for the male sex , regardless of age or tempera , had been uncanni -- '' natur , she be a love-child , '' said the old women . and from fourteen on , it grew steadili . it would be difficult for one who has not live in a small town to understand exact the kind of isol to which sutherland consign the girl without her realiz it , without their fulli realiz it themselv . everyon was friend with her . a stranger would not have notic ani differ in the treatment of her and of her cousin ruth . yet not one of the young men would have thought of marri her , would have regard her as his equal or the equal of his sister . she went to all the general entertain . she was invit to all the hous when failur to invit her would have seem point -- but onli then . she did not think much about herself ; she was fond of studi -- fonder of read -- fondest , perhap , of make dress and hat , especi for ruth , whom she thought much prettier than herself . thus , she was onli vagu , subconsci conscious of there be someth peculiar and mysteri in her lot . this isol , rather than her domin qualiti of self-effac consider for other , was the chief caus of the extraordinari innoc of her mind . no servant , no girl , no audaci boy ever ventur to rais with her ani question remot touch on sex . all those question seem to puritan sutherland in ani circumst high indel ; in relat to susan they seem wors than indel , dread though the thought was that there could be anyth wors than indelicaci . at fifteen she remain as unawar of even the exist of the mysteri of sex as she had been at birth . noth definit enough to arous her curios had ever been said in her hear ; and such refer to those matter as she found in her read pass her by , as ani matter of which he has not the begin of knowledg will fail to arrest the attent of ani reader . it was general assum that she knew all about her origin , that someon had , some time or other , told her . even her aunt fanni thought so , thought she was hide the knowledg deep in her heart , explain in that way her content with the solitud of book and sew . susan was the worst possibl influenc in ruth 's life . our charact is ourself , is born with us , cling to us as the flesh to our bone , persist unchang until we die . but upon the circumst that surround us depend what part of our charact shall show itself . ruth was born with perhap someth more than the normal tendenc to be envious and petti . but these qualiti might never have shown themselv conspicu had there been no susan for her to envi . the veri qualiti that made susan lovabl react upon the pretti , pert blond cousin to make her the more unlov . again and again , when she and susan were about to start out togeth , and susan would appear in beauti and grace of person and dress , ruth would excus herself , would fli to her room to lock herself in and weep and rage and hate . and at the high school , when susan score in a recit or in some dramat entertain , ruth would sit with bitten lip and surg bosom , pale with jealousi . susan 's isol , the way the boy avoid have with her the friend relat that spring up natur among young peopl these gave ruth a partial reveng . but susan , seem unconsci , rise sweet and seren abov all petti -- ruth 's hatr deepen , though she hid it from everyon , almost from herself . and she depend more and more utter upon susan to select her cloth for her , to dress her , to make her look well ; for susan had tast and ruth had not . on that bright june morn as the cousin went up main street togeth , susan gave herself over to the delight of sun and air and of the flower garden befor the attract hous they were pass ; ruth , with the day quit dark for her , all it joy gone , was fight against a hatr of her cousin so vicious that it made her afraid . `` i ll have no chanc at all , '' her angri heart was say , `` so long as susi 's around , keep everybodi remind of the famili shame . '' and that was a truth she could not downfac , mean and ungener though think it might be . the worst of all was that susan , in a simpl white dress and an almost untrim white straw hat with a grace curv to it brim and set at the right angl upon that wavi dark hair , was make the beauti of her short blond cousin dim and somehow common . at the corner of mapl street ruth 's self-control reach it limit . she halt , took the sampl of silk from her glove . there was not a hint of her feel in her counten , for shame and the desir to seem to be better than she was were fast make her an adept in hypocrisi . `` you go ahead and match it for mamma , '' said she . `` i ve got to run in and see bessi andrew . '' `` but i promis uncl georg i 'd come and help him with the month bill , '' object susan . `` you can do both . it ll take you onli a minut . if mother had known you were go uptown , she 'd never have trust _me_ . '' and ruth had tuck the sampl in susan 's belt and was hurri out mapl street . there was noth for susan to do but go on alon . two squar , and she was pass the show place of sutherland , the home of the wright . she paus to regal herself with a glanc into the grove of magnific elm with lawn and bright garden beyond -- for the wright place fill the entir squar between broad and myrtl street and from main to monro . she was start on when she saw among the tree a young man in stripe flannel . at the same instant he saw her . `` hel-_lo_ , susi !

'' `` i ll see about that , '' cri sam . `` you ll be ask all right , all right . '' `` no , '' said susan . she was one of those whose way of say no give it full mean and intent . `` i ll not be ask , thank you -- and i ll not go if i am .

'' exclaim he . `` i haven't seen anyon that could hold a candl to you even in the east . '' susan laugh and blush with pleasur . `` go on , '' said she with railleri . `` i love it . '' `` come in and sit under the tree and i ll fill all the time you ll give me . '' this remind her . `` i must hurri uptown , '' she said . `` good-bi . '' `` hold on !

'' sam wave at ruth and call , `` hello ! glad to see you . '' ruth was all sweet and smile . she and her mother -- quit privat and with noth open said on either side -- had canvass sam as a `` possibl .

'' sam tri to conceal that he was swell with pride . `` oh , this is noth , '' said he deprec . ruth 's heart was a-flutt . the fisher pictur of the chamber love-mak , thought she , might almost be a photograph of sam . she was glad she had obey the mysteri impuls to make a toilett of unusu eleg that morn . how get rid of susan ? `` _i_ ll take the sampl , susi , '' said she . `` then you wo n't have to keep father wait . '' susi gave up the sampl . her face was no longer so bright and interest . `` oh , drop it , '' cri sam . `` come in -- both of you . i ll telephon for joe andrew and we ll take a drive -- or anyth you like .

'' `` come on , ruth , '' cri sam . `` let 's walk uptown with her . '' `` and you can help match the silk , '' said ruth . `` not for me , '' repli young wright . then to susan , `` what ve _you_ got to do ? mayb it 's someth i could help at . '' `` no . it 's for uncl georg and me . '' `` well , i ll go as far as the store . then -- we ll see . '' they were now in the busi part of main street , were at wilson 's dri good store . `` you might find it here , '' suggest the innoc susan to her cousin . ruth color , veil her eye to hide their flash . `` i ve got to go to the store first -- to get some money , '' she hastili improvis . sam had been walk between the two girl . he now chang to the outsid and , so , put himself next susan alon , put susan between him and ruth . the maneuv seem to be a mere polit , but ruth knew better . what fate had intend as her lucki day was be chang into unlucki by this cousin of her . ruth walk sullen along , hot tear in her eye and a choke in her throat , as she listen to sam 's flatter of her cousin , and to susan 's laugh , delight repli . she tri to gather herself togeth , to think up someth funni or at least interest with which to break into the _tete-a-tete_ and draw sam to herself . she could think noth but envious , hate thought . at the door of warham and compani , wholesal and retail grocer , the three halt . `` i guess i ll go to vandermark 's , '' said ruth . `` i realli don't need money . come on , sam . '' `` no -- i 'm go back home . i ought to see lotti and father . my , but it 's dull in this town ! '' `` well , so long , '' said susan . she nod , sparkl of hair and skin and eye , and went into the store . sam and ruth watch her as she walk down the broad aisl between the counter . from the store came a mingl of odor of fruit , of spice , of fresh ground coffe . `` susan 's an aw pretti girl , is n't she ?

'' cri she . `` where 's the silk ? it 's for your dress tonight , you know . '' `` it ll be along , '' was ruth 's answer , her tone dreari , her lip quiver . `` i met sam wright . '' `` oh ! '' exclaim her mother . `` he 's back , is he ?

'' susan sparkl at the idea of a young man , and _such_ a young man , take troubl for her . ruth , pale , kept her eye down and her lip compress . she was pictur the gallant appear the young sophomor from yale , away off in the gorgeous fashion east , would make as he came in at that gate yonder and up the walk and seat himself on the veranda -- with susan ! evid her mother had fail ; susan was not to be taken away . when warham depart down the walk ruth rose ; she could not bear be alon with her triumphant rival -- triumphant becaus unconsci . she knew that to get sam to herself all she would have to do would be to hint to susan , the generous , what she want . but pride forbad that . as her hand was on the knob of the screen door , susan said : `` whi do n't you like sam ? '' `` oh , i think he 's stuck-up . he 's been spoil in the east . '' `` whi , i do n't see ani sign of it . '' `` you were too flatter by his talk to you , '' said ruth , with a sweet-sour littl laugh -- an asp of a sneer hid in a basket of flower . susan felt the sting ; but , see onli the flower , did not dream whenc it had come . `` it _was_ nice , was n't it ? '' said she , gayli . `` mayb you re right about him , but i ca n't help like him . you must admit he 's handsom . '' `` he has a bad look in his eye , '' repli ruth . such rage against susan was swell within her that it seem to her she would faint if she did not releas at least part of it . `` you want to look out for him , susi , '' said she , calm and even . `` you do n't want to take what he say serious . '' `` of cours not , '' said susan , quit honest , though she , no more than the next human be , could avoid take serious whatev was pleasant flatter . `` he 'd never think of marri you .

'' call her mother . `` the dress is readi for the last try-on . i think it 's go to hang beauti . '' ruth drag herself up the stair , lag into the sitting-room , gaze at the dress with a scowl . `` what did father say ? '' she ask . `` it 's no use tri to do anyth with your father . '' ruth flung herself in a corner of the sofa . `` the onli thing i can think of , '' said her mother , humbl and timid , `` is phone the sinclair as i origin set out to do . '' `` and have the whole town laugh at me . . . . oh , what do i care , anyhow !

'' but arthur , a mere promis , seem poor inde besid sam , the actual arriv . to marri sam would be to step at onc into grandeur ; to marri arthur would mean year of struggl . besid , arthur was heavi , at least seem heavi to light ruth , while sam was her ideal of gay eleg . `` i _detest_ arthur sinclair , '' she now announc . `` you can get sam if you want him , '' said her mother confid . `` one even with a mere child like susi is n't go to amount to much .

'' ruth dri her eye as she gaze . the dress was inde love . but her pleasur in it was shadow by the remembr that most of the loveli was due to susan 's suggest . still , she tri it on , and felt better . she would linger until sam came , would exhibit herself to him ; and sure he would not tarri long with susan . this project improv the situat great . she began her toilet for the even at onc , though it was onli three o'clock . susan finish her press and start to dress at five -- becaus she knew ruth would be appeal to her to come in and help put the finish touch to the toilet for the parti . and , sure enough , at half-past five , befor she had near finish , ruth , with a sneak humil , beg her to come `` for half a minut -- if you do n't mind -- and have got time . '' susan did ruth 's hair over , made her chang to anoth color of stock and slipper , put the dress on her , did near an hour 's refit and redrap . both were late for supper ; and after supper susan had to make certain final amend to the wonder toilet , and then get herself readi . so it was ruth alon who went down when sam wright came . `` my , but you do look all to the good , ruth ! '' cri sam . and his eye no less than his tone show that he meant it . he had n't realiz what a soft white neck the blond cousin had , or how perfect her shoulder round into her slim arm . as ruth move to depart , he said : '' do n't be in such a rush . wait till susi finish her primp and come down . '' `` she had to help me , '' said ruth , with a righteous she could just plume herself upon . `` that 's whi she 's late . no , i must get along .

'' sam , at the edg of the veranda , regret his promis to call on susan , was rous by her voic : `` did you ever see anyth as love as ruth ? '' sam 's regret vanish the instant he look at her , and the greedi express came into his sensual , confid young face . `` she 's a corker , '' said he . `` but i 'm content to be where i am . '' susan 's dress was not cut out in the neck , was simpli of the collarless kind girl of her age wear . it reveal the smooth , voluptu yet slender column of her throat . and her arm , bare to just abov the elbow , were exquisit . but susan fascin did not lie in ani or in all of her charm , but in that subtleti of magnet which account for all the sensat phenomena of the relat of men and women . she was a clever girl -- clever beyond her year , perhap -- though in this day seventeen is not far from fulli develop womanhood . but even had she been silli , men would have been glad to linger on and on under the spell of the sex call which natur had subt woven into the textur of her voic , into the glanc of her eye , into the delic eman of her skin . they talk of all manner of thing -- game and colleg east and west -- the wonder of new york -- the weather , final . sam was everi moment of the time puzzl how to bring up the one subject that interest both abov all other , that interest him to the exclus of all other . he was an ardent student of the game of man and woman , had made consider progress at it -- remark progress , in view of his bare twenti year . he had devis as mani `` open '' as an expert chess player . none seem to fit this difficult case how to make love to a girl of his own class whom his convent , social ambiti natur forbad him to consid marri . as he observ her in the moonlight , he said to himself : `` i ve got to look out or i'll make a damn fool of myself with her .

'' and move beyond her power to control herself , she broke from his detain hand and fled into the hous . she dart up to her room , paus in the middl of the floor , her hand clasp over her wild beat heart . when she could move she threw open the shutter and went out on the balconi . she lean against the window frame and gaze up at the star , instinct seek the companionship of the infinit . curious enough , she thought littl about sam . she was awe and wonderstruck befor the strang mysteri event within her , the open up , the flower of her soul . these vast emot , where did they come from ? what were they ? whi did she long to burst into laughter , to burst into tear ? whi did she do neither , but simpli stand motionless , with the star blaze and reel in the sky and her heart beat like mad and her blood surg and eb ? was this -- love ? yes -- it must be love . oh , how wonder love was -- and how sad -- and how happi beyond all laughter -- and how sweet ! she felt an enorm tender for everybodi and for everyth , for all the world -- an overwhelm sens of beauti and good . her lip were move . she was amaz to find she was repeat the one prayer she knew , the one aunt fanni had taught her in babyhood . whi should she find herself pray ? love -- love love ! she was a woman and she love ! so this was what it meant to be a woman ; it meant to love ! she was rous by the sound of ruth say good night to someon at the gate , invis becaus of the interven foliag . whi , it must be dread late . the dipper had move away round to the south , and the heat of the day was all gone , and the air was full of the cool , scent breath of leav and flower and grass . ruth 's light shone out upon the balconi . susan turn to slip into her own room . but ruth heard , call out peevish : '' who 's there ? '' `` onli me , '' cri susan . she long to go in and embrac ruth , and kiss her . she would have like to ask ruth to let her sleep with her , but she felt ruth would n't understand . `` what are you do out there ?

'' `` whi , what do you mean ? '' ask susan wonder . `` be care ! he 'd never think for a minut of marri you . '' the word meant noth to susan ; but the tone stab into her heart . `` whi not ? '' she said . ruth look at her cousin , hung her head in shame . `` go -- go ! '' she beg . `` pleas go . i 'm a bad girl -- bad -- _bad_ ! go ! '' and , cri hyster , she push amaz susan through the connect door , close and bolt it . chapter iv when fanni warham was young her mother -- compel by her father -- rous -- '' rout out '' -- the children at half-past six on week day and at seven on sunday for prayer and breakfast , no matter what time they had gone to bed the night befor . the horror of this made such an impress upon her that she never permit ruth and susan to be awaken ; alway they slept until they had `` had their sleep out . '' regular was no doubt an excel thing for health and for moral disciplin ; but the best rule could be carri to foolish extrem . until the last year mrs. warham had made her two girl live a life of the strictest simplic and regular , with the result that they were the most amaz , sound , healthi girl in sutherland . and the regimen still held , except when they had compani in the even or went out -- and mrs. warham saw to it that there was not too much of that sort of thing . in all her life thus far susan had never slept less than ten hour , rare less than twelv . it lack less than a minut of ten o'clock the morn after sam 's call when susan 's eye open upon her simpl , pale-gray bedroom , neat and fresh . she look sleepili at the littl clock on the night stand . `` merci me ! '' she cri . and her bare feet were on the floor and she was stretch her lith young bodi , weak from the relax of her profound sleep . she heard someon stir in ruth 's room ; instant ruth remark , `` he 'd never think for a minut of marri you , '' pop into her head . it still meant noth to her . she could not have explain whi it came back or whi she fell to puzzl over it as if it held some mysteri mean . perhap the reason was that from earli childhood there had been accumul in some duski chamber of her mind stray happen and remark , all bare upon the unsuspect secret of her birth and the unsuspect strang of her posit in the world where everyon els was definit place and ticket . she was wonder about ruth 's queer hyster outburst , evid the result of a quarrel with arthur sinclair . `` i guess ruth care more for him than she let on , '' thought she . this love that had come to her so sudden and miracul made her alert for sign of love elsewher . she went to the bolt connect door ; she could not rememb when it had ever been bolt befor , and she felt forlorn and shut out . `` ruth ! '' she call . `` is that you ? '' a brief silenc , then a faint `` yes . '' `` may i come in ? '' `` you 'd better take your bath and get downstair . '' this remind her that she was hungri . she gather her undercloth togeth , and with the bundl in her arm dart across the hall into the bathroom . the cold water act as champagn promis to act but doe n't . she felt giddi with health and happi . and the bright sun was flood the bathroom , and the odor from the big bed of hyacinth in the side lawn scent the warm breez from the open window . when she dash back to her room she was sing , and her sing voic was as charm as her speak voic promis . a few minut and her hair had gone up in careless grace and she was clad in a fresh dress of tan linen , full in the blous . this , with her tan stock and tan slipper and the radiant youth of her face , gave her a look of utter clean and fresh that was exceed good to see . `` i 'm readi , '' she call . there was no answer ; doubtless ruth had alreadi descend . she rush downstair and into the dining-room . no one was at the littl tabl set in one of the window in readi for the late breakfast . molli came , bring cocoa , a cereal , hot biscuit and crab-appl preserv , all attract arrang on a larg tray . `` i did n't bring much , miss susi , '' she apolog . `` it 's so late , and i do n't want you to spoil your dinner . we re go to have the grandest chicken that ever came out of an egg .

'' `` she ai n't come down . she 's got a headach . it was that salad for supper over to sinclair ' last night . salad ai n't fit for a dog to eat , nohow -- that 's _my_ opinion . and at night -- it 's sure to bust your face out or give you the headach or both . '' susan ate with her usual enthusiasm , think the while of sam and wonder how she could contriv to see him . she rememb her promis to her uncl . she had not eaten near so much as she want . but up she sprang and in fifteen minut was on her way to the store . she had seen neither ruth nor her aunt . `` _he_ ll be wait for me to pass , '' she thought . and she was not disappoint . there he stood , at the footpath gate into his father 's place . he had array himself in a blue and white flannel suit , white hat and shoe ; a big expensive-look cigarett adorn his lip . the martin , the delevan , the castl and the bowen , neighbor across the way , were watch him admir through the mesh of lace window curtain . she expect that he would come forward eager . instead , he continu to lean indol on the gate , as if unawar of her approach . and when she was close at hand , his bow and smile were , so it seem to her , almost cold polit . into her eye came a confus , hurt express . `` susi -- sweetheart , '' he said , the voic in as astonish contrast as the word to his air of friend indiffer . `` they re watch us from the window all around here . '' `` oh -- yes , '' assent she , as if she understood . but she did n't . in sutherland the young peopl were not so mind of gossip , which it was imposs to escap , anyhow . still -- off there in the east , no doubt , they had more refin way ; without a doubt , whatev sam did was the correct thing . `` do you still care as you did last night ? '' he ask . the effect of his word upon her was so obvious that he glanc nervous round . it was delight to be abl to evok a love like this ; but he did wish other were n't look . `` i 'm go to uncl 's store , '' she said . `` i 'm late .

'' `` yes -- do come down . but -- ruth ll be there . i believ arti sinclair 's come . '' `` oh , that counter-jump ? '' she look at him in surpris . `` he 's an aw nice fellow , '' said she . `` about the nicest in town . '' `` of cours , '' repli sam elabor . `` i beg your pardon . they think differ about those thing in the east . '' `` what thing ? '' `` no matter . '' sam , whose secret dream was to marri some fashion eastern woman and cut a dash in fifth avenu life , had no intent of explain what was what to one who would not understand , would not approv , and would be made auspici of him . `` i suppos ruth and sinclair ll pair off and give us a chanc . '' `` you ll come ? '' `` right after din -- supper , i mean . in the east we have dinner in the even . '' `` is n't that queer ! '' exclaim susan . but she was think of the joy in store for her at the close of the day . `` i must go back now , '' said sam . far up the street he saw his sister 's poni cart come . `` you might as well walk to the store . '' it seem to her that they both had ever so much to say to each other , and had said noth . `` no . i ca n't go ani further . good-bi -- that is , till tonight . '' he was red and stammer . as they shook hand emot made them speechless . he stumbl awkward as he turn to leav , becam still more hot self-consci when he saw the grin on the face of the group of lounger at a pack case near the curb . susan did not see the loafer , did not see anyth distinct . her feet sought the uneven brick sidewalk uncertain , and the blood was pour into her cheek , was steam in her brain , make a red mist befor her eye . she was glad he had left her . the joy of be with him was so keen that it was pain . now she could breath freeli and could dream -- dream -- dream . she made blunder after blunder in work over the account with her uncl , and he began to teas her . `` you sure are in love , browni , '' declar he . her pain but happi blush delight him . `` tell me all about it ?

'' susan color violent . `` what ? '' laugh warham . `` are _you_ go to have a beau too ? '' susan felt two pair of feminin eye pounc -- hostil eye , savag curious . she pale with fright as queer , as unpreced , as those hostil glanc . it seem to her that she had done or was about to do someth crimin . she could not speak . an aw silenc , then her aunt -- she no longer seem her love aunt -- ask in an omin voic : `` is someon come to see you , susan ?

'' warham stare in amaz . `` now , what doe _that_ mean ? '' he demand . `` you know veri well what it mean , '' retort his wife . her tone made him understand . he redden , and with too bluster anger brought his fist down on the tabl . `` susan 's our daughter . she 's ruth 's sister . '' ruth push back her chair and stood up . her express made her look much older than she was . `` i wish you could induc the rest of the town to think that , papa , '' said she . `` it 'd make my posit less pain . '' and she , too , left the room . `` what 's she talk about ? '' ask warham . `` it 's true , georg , '' repli fanni with trembl lip . `` it 's all my fault -- insist on keep her . i might have known ! '' `` i think you and ruth must be crazi . i ve seen no sign . '' `` have you seen ani of the boy call on susan sinc she shot up from a child to a girl ? have n't you notic she is n't invit ani more except when it ca n't be avoid ? '' warham 's face was fieri with rage . he look helpless , furious about . but he said noth . to fight public sentiment would be like tri to thrust back with one 's fist an oncreep fog . final he cri , `` it 's too outrag to talk about . '' `` if i onli knew what to do !

'' ruth gave a low scream and shudder . susan look round defiant , as if she expect a bolt from the blue to come hurtl through the open window . but the sky remain seren , and the quiet , scent breez continu to play with the lace curtain , and the bird on the balconi did not suspend their chatter courtship . this lack of immedi effect from her declar of war upon man and god was encourag . the last of the crush , cow feel ruth had inspir the night befor disappear . with a soul haughtili plume and look defianc from the violet-gray eye , susan left her cousin and betook herself down to breakfast . in common with most children , she had alway dream of a mysteri fate for herself , differ from the commonplac routin around her . ruth 's revel , far from daunt her , far from make her feel like cring befor the world in gratitud for it toler of her bar sinist , seem a fascin tragic confirm of her romant long and belief . no doubt it was the differ from the common lot that had attract sam to her ; and this differ would make their love wholli unlik the commonplac sutherland woo and wed . yes , her had been a mysteri fate , and would continu to be . nora , an old woman now , had often relat in her presenc how doctor steven had brought her to life when she lay appar , inde realli , dead upon the upstair sitting-room tabl -- doctor steven and nora 's own prayer . an extraordinari birth , in defianc of the law of god and man ; an extraordinari resurrect , in defianc of the law of natur -- yes , her would be a life superbl differ from the common . and when she and sam marri , how gracious and forgiv she would be to all those bad-heart peopl ; how she would shame them for their evil thought against her mother and herself ! the susan lenox who sat alon at the littl tabl in the dining-room window , eat bread and butter and honey in the comb , was appar the same susan lenox who had taken three meal a day in that room all those year -- was , inde , actual the same , for charact is not an overnight creation . yet it was an amaz differ susan lenox , too . the first crisi had come ; she had been put to the test ; and she had not collaps in weak but had stood erect in strength . after breakfast she went down main street and at crook creek avenu took the turn for the cemeteri . she sought the warham plot , on the western slope near the quiet brook . there was a clump of cedar at each corner of the plot ; near the largest of them were three littl grave -- the three dead children of georg and fanni . in the shadow of the clump and nearest the brook was a fourth grave apart and , to the girl , now thrill mysteri : lorella lenox born may 9 , 1859 die juli 17 , 1879 twenti year old ! susan 's tear scald her eye . onli a littl older than her cousin ruth was now -- ruth who often seem to her , and to everybodi , younger than herself . `` and she was good -- i know she was good ! '' thought susan . `` _he_ was bad , and the peopl who took his part against her were bad . but _she_ was good ! '' she start as sam 's voic , gay and light , sound direct behind her . `` what are you do in a graveyard ? '' cri he . `` how did you find me ? '' she ask , pale and flush and pale again . `` i ve been follow you ever sinc you left home .

'' sam , red and shift uneasili , could not even keep his downcast eye upon the same spot of ground . `` you see , '' she went on , sweet and grave , `` they do n't understand what love mean -- do they ? '' `` i guess not , '' mutter he , complet unnerv . whi , how serious the girl had taken him and his word -- such a few word and not at all definit ! no , he decid , it was the kiss . he had heard of girl so innoc that they thought a kiss meant the same as be marri . he got himself togeth as well as he could and look at her . `` but , susi , '' he said , `` you re too young for anyth definit -- and i 'm not halfway through colleg . '' `` i understand , '' said she . `` but you need not be afraid i ll chang . '' she was so sweet , so magnet , so compel that in spite of the frown of prudenc he seiz her hand . at her touch he flung prudenc to the wind . `` i love you , '' he cri ; and put his arm around her , he tri to kiss her . she gentl but strong repuls him . `` whi not , dear ? '' he plead . `` you love me -- do n't you ? '' `` yes , '' she repli , her honest eye shine upon his . `` but we must wait until we re marri . i do n't care so much for the other , but i 'd not want uncl georg to feel i had disgrac him . '' `` whi , there 's no harm in a kiss , '' plead he . `` kiss you is -- differ , '' she repli . `` it 's -- it 's -- marriag . '' he understood her innoc that frank assum marriag where a sophist girl would , in the guilt of design thought , have shrunk in shame from howev vagu suggest such a thing . he realiz to the full his peril . `` i 'm a damn fool , '' he said to himself , `` to hang about her . but somehow i ca n't help it -- i ca n't ! '' and the truth was , he love her as much as a boy of his age is capabl of love , and he would have gone on and marri her but for the snobbish smear on him by the provinci of the small town and burn in by the toadyism of his fashion colleg set . as he look at her he saw beauti beyond ani he had ever seen elsewher and a sweet and honesti that made him asham befor her . `` no , i could n't harm her , '' he told himself . `` i 'm not such a dog as that . but there no harm in love her and kiss her and make her as happi as it 's right to be . '' `` do n't be mean , susan , '' he beg , tear in his eye . `` if you love me , you ll let me kiss you . '' and she yield , and the shock of the kiss set both to trembl . it appeal to his vaniti , it heighten his own agit to see how pale she had grown and how her round bosom rose and fell in the wild tumult of her emot . `` oh , i ca n't do without see you , '' she cri . `` and aunt fanni has forbidden me . '' `` i thought so ! '' exclaim he . `` i did what i could last night to throw them off the track . if ruth had onli known what i was think about all the time . where were you ? '' `` upstair -- on the balconi . '' `` i felt it , '' he declar . `` and when she sang love song i could hard keep from rush up to you . susi , we _must_ see each other . '' `` i can come here , almost ani day . '' `` but peopl 'd soon find out -- and they 'd say all sort of thing . and your uncl and aunt would hear . '' there was no disput anyth so obvious . `` could n't you come down tonight , after the other are in bed and the hous is quiet ? '' he suggest . she hesit befor the decept , though she felt that her famili had forfeit the right to control her . but love , be the suprem necess , conquer . `` for a few minut , '' she conced . she had been absorb ; but his eye , kept alert by his convent soul , had seen sever peopl at a distanc observ without seem to do so . `` we must separ , '' he now said . `` you see , susi , we must n't be gossip about . you know how determin they are to keep us apart . '' `` yes -- yes , '' she eager agre . `` will you go first , or shall i ? '' `` you go -- the way you came . i ll jump the brook down where it narrow and cut across and into our place by the back way . what time tonight ? '' `` arthur 's come , '' reflect susi aloud . `` ruth ll not let him stay late . she ll be sleepi and will go straight to bed . about half past ten . if i 'm not on the front veranda -- no , the side veranda -- by eleven , you ll know someth has prevent . '' `` but you ll sure come ? '' `` i ll come . '' and it both thrill and alarm him to see how much in earnest she was . but he look love into her love eye and went away , too intox to care whither this adventur was lead him . at dinner she felt she was no longer a part of this famili . were they not all piti and look down on her in their heart ? she was like a deform person who has alway imagin the consider he has had was natur and equal , and sudden discov that it is piti for his deform . she now acut felt her aunt 's , her cousin 's , dislik ; and her uncl gentl was not less gall . in her soft round youth face there was reveal definit for the first time an under express of strength , of what is often confus with it feebl counterfeit , obstinaci -- that power to resist circumst which make the unusu and the firm charact . the young mobil of her featur suggest the easi sway of the babi sapl in the gentlest breez . singular at varianc with it was this express of tenac . such an express in the face of the young infal forecast an agit and agit life . it seem amaz out of place in susan becaus theretofor she had never been put to the test in ani but unnot trifl and so had given the impress that she was as docil as she was fear of give annoy or pain and indiffer to have her own way . those who have this tempera of strength encas in gentl are invari misunderstood . when they assert themselv , though they are in the particular instanc wholli right , they are regard as wholli and outrag wrong . life deal hard with them , punish them for the mistaken notion of themselv they have through forbear and gentl of heart permit an unobserv world to form . susan spent the afternoon on the balconi befor her window , read and sew -- or , rather , dream over first a book , then a dress . when she enter the dining-room at supper time the other were alreadi seat . she saw instant that someth had occur -- someth omin for her . mrs. warham gave her a penetr , sever look and lower her eye ; ruth was gaze sullen at her plate . warham 's glanc was stern and reproach . she took her place opposit ruth , and the meal was eaten in silenc . ruth left the tabl first . next mrs. warham rose and say , `` susan , when you ve finish , i wish to see you in the sitting-room upstair , '' swept in solemn digniti from the room . susan rose at onc to follow . as she was pass her uncl he put out his hand and detain her . `` i hope it was onli a foolish girl 's piec of nonsens , '' said he with an attempt at his wont kindli . `` and i know it won't occur again . but when your aunt say thing you wo n't like to hear , rememb that you brought this on yourself and that she love you as we all do and is think onli of your good . '' `` what is it , uncl georg ? '' cri susan , amaz . `` what have i done ? '' warham look stern griev . `` browni , '' he reproach , `` you must n't deceiv . go to your aunt . '' she found her aunt seat stiffli in the living-room , her hand fold upon her stomach . so gradual had been the crucial middle-lif chang in fanni that no one had note it . this even susan , becom morbid acut , sudden realiz the contrast between the sever , uncertain-temp aunt of today and the amiabl , altogeth and alway gentl aunt of two year befor . `` what is it , aunt ? '' she said , feel as if she were befor a stranger and an enemi . `` the whole town is talk about your disgrac do this morn , '' ruth 's mother repli in a hard voic . the color leap in susan 's cheek . `` yesterday i forbad you to see sam wright again . and alreadi you disobey .

'' the sex impuls is prolif of generous impuls . he , sit so close to her and breath in through his skin the eman of her young magnet , was move to the depth by the pictur her word conjur . this beauti girl , a mere child , born and bred in the ladi class , wander away penniless and alon , to be a prey to the world 's buffet which , sever enough in realiti , seem savag beyond endur to the children of wealth . as he pictur it his heart impuls expand . it was at his lip to offer to marri her . but his real self -- and one 's real self is vast differ from one 's impuls -- his real self forbad the word passag . not even the sex impuls , intox him as it then was , could dethron snobbish calcul . he was young ; so while he did not speak , he felt asham of himself for not speak . he felt that she must be expect him to speak , that she had the right to expect it . he drew a littl away from her , and kept silent . `` the time will soon pass , '' said she absent . `` the time ? then you intend to come back ? '' `` i mean the time until you re through colleg and we can be togeth . '' she spoke as one speak of a dream as to which one has never a doubt but that it will come true . it was so preposter , this idea that he would marri her , especi after she had been a servant or god know what for sever year -- it was so absurd that he burst into a sweat of nervous terror . and he hastili drew further away . she felt the chang , for she was of those who are born sensit . but she was far too young and inexperienc to have learn to interpret aright the subtl warn of the nerv . `` you are displeas with me ? '' she ask timid . `` no -- oh , no , susi , '' he stammer . `` i -- i was think . do put off go for a day or two . there 's no need of hurri . '' but she felt that by disobey her aunt and come down to see him she had forfeit the right to shelter under that roof . `` i ca n't go back , '' said she . `` there 's a reason . '' she would not tell him the reason ; it would make him feel as if he were to blame . `` when i get a place in cincinnati , '' she went on , `` i ll write to you .

'' her calm deceiv her into think herself perfect sane and sober , perfect awar of what she was about . she had left her hat and her bundl behind the door . she put on the hat in the dark of the hall with steadi finger , took up the well-fil shawl strap and went forth , close the door behind her . in the morn they would find the door unlock but that would not caus much talk , as sutherland peopl were all rather careless about lock up . they would not knock at the door of her room until noon , perhap . then they would find on the pincushion the letter she had written to her uncl , say good-bi and explain that she had decid to remov forev the taint of her mother and herself from their hous and their live -- a somewhat theatric letter , model upon ouida , whom she thought the greatest writer that had ever live , victor hugo and two or three poet perhap except . her bundl was not light , but she hard felt it as she move swift through the desert , moonlit street toward the river . the wharf boat for the cincinnati and louisvill mail steamer was anchor at the foot of pine street . on the leve befor it were pile the box , bag , case , crate , barrel to be load upon the `` up boat . '' she was descend the gentl slope toward this mass of freight when her blood tingl at a deep , hoars , mourn whistl from far away ; she knew it was the up boat , round the bend and sight the town . the sound echo music back and forth between the kentucki and the indiana bluff , die linger away . again the whistl boom , again the dark forest-clad steep sent the echo to and fro across the broad silver river . and now she could see the steamer , at the bend -- a dark mass pick out with brilliant dot of light ; the big funnel , the two thick pennant of black smoke . and she could hear the faint pleasant stroke of the paddl of the big side wheel upon the water . at the wharf boat there had not been a sign of life . but with the die away of the second whistl light -- the light of lantern -- appear on the leve close to the water 's edg and on the wharf boat itself . and , behind her , the door of the sutherland hotel open and it offic lit up , in prepar for ani chanc arriv . she turn abrupt out of the beaten path down the gravel leve , made for the lower and darker end of the wharf boat . there would be sutherland peopl go up the river . but they would be more than prompt ; everyon came earli to boat and train to begin the sweet draught of the excit of journey . so she would wait in the dark and go aboard when the steamer was about to draw in it plank . at the upper end of the wharf boat there was the broad gangway to the leve for passeng and freight ; at the lower and dark and desert end a narrow beam extend from boat to shore , to hold the boat steadi . susan , balanc herself with her bundl , went up to the beam , sat down upon a low stanchion in the dark where she could see the river . louder and louder grew the regular music beat of engin and paddl . the searchlight on the forward deck of the _gener lytle_ , after peer uncertain , suspici , at the entir leve , and at the river , and at the kentucki shore , abrupt focus upon the wharf boat . the _gener lytle_ now seem a blaze of light -- from lower deck , from saloon deck , from pilot hous deck , and forward and astern . a hundr interest sound came from her -- tinkl of bell , call from deck to deck , whistl , creak of pulley , low of cattl , grunt of swine , plaint of agit sheep , the resign cluck of mani chicken . along the rail of the middl or saloon deck were seat a few passeng who had not yet gone to bed . on the lower deck was a swarm of black roustabout , their sooti anim face , their uncannili contrast white teeth and eyebal , their strang and vari rag lit up by the torch blaze where a gangplank lay readi for run out . and high and clear in the love june night sail the moon , spread a faint benign light upon hill and shore and glisten river , upon the grace , state mail steamer , now advanc majest upon the wharf boat . susan watch all , saw all , with quick beat heart and quiver interest . it was the first time that her life had been visit by the fascin sens of event , real event . the tall , proud , impetu child-woman , stand in the semi-dark besid her bundl , was about to cast her stake upon the tabl in a bold game with destini . her eye shone with the wonder express that is seen onli when courag gaze into the bright face of danger . the steamer touch the edg of the wharf-boat with gentl care ; the wharf-boat sway and groan . even as the gangplank were push out , the rag , fantast roustabout , with wild , savag , hilari cri , ran and jump and scrambl to the wharf-boat like a band of escap lunat and dart down it shore plank to pounc upon the pile of freight . the mate , at the steamer edg to superintend the load , and the wharf master on the leve besid the freight releas each a hoars torrent of profan to spur on the yell , laugh roustabout , more brute than man . torch flare ; cow and sheep , pig and chicken , utter each it own cri of dissatisfact or dismay ; the mate and wharf master curs becaus it was the custom to curs ; the roustabout rush ashor empty-hand , came file back , stoop under their burden . it was a scene of anim , of excit , savag , grotesqu , fascin . susan , trembl a littl , so tens were her nerv , wait until the last struggl roustabout were stagger on the boat , until the deep whistl sound , warn of approach departur . then she took up her bundl and put herself in the line of roustabout , between a half-nak negro , black as coal and bear a small barrel of beer , and a half-nak mulatto bear a bundl of loud-smel untan skin . `` get out of the way , ladi !

'' she rememb his face but not his name . she rememb him as one of the `` river charact '' regard as outcast by the christian respect of sutherland . but she who could not but be polit to everybodi smile pleasant , though she did not like his express as he look at her . `` no , i 'm alon , '' said she . `` oh -- your friend are go to meet you at the wharf in the morn , '' said he , content with his own explan . `` just sign here , pleas . '' and , as she wrote , he went on : `` i ve got one room left . ai n't that lucki ? it 's a nice one , too . you ll be veri comfort . everybodi at home well ? i ai n't been in sutherland for nigh ten year . everi week or so i think i will , and then somehow i do n't . here 's your key -- number 34 right-hand side , well down toward the far end , yonder . two dollar , pleas . thank you -- exact right . hope you sleep well . '' `` thank you , '' said susan . she turn away with the key which was thrust through one end of a stick about a foot long , to make it too bulki for absent-mind passeng to pocket . she took up her bundl , walk down the long saloon with it gilt decor , it crystal chandeli , it doubl array of small door , each number . the clerk look after her , admir of the fine curv of her shoulder , back , and hip written plain upon his insignific featur . and it was a free admir he would not have dare show had she not been a daughter of illegitimaci -- a girl whose mother 's `` loos '' rais pleas if scandal suggest and even possibl in the mind of everi man with a carnal eye . and not unnatur . to think of her was to think of the circumst surround her come into the world ; and to think of those circumst was to think of immor . susan , all unconsci of that pollut and impud gaze , was soon stand befor the narrow door number 34 , as she bare made out , for the lamp in the saloon chandeli were turn low . she unlock it , enter the small clean stateroom and deposit her bundl on the floor . with just a glanc at her quarter she hurri to the opposit door -- the one give upon the promenad . she open it , step out , cross the desert deck and stood at the rail . the _gener lytle_ was draw slowli away from the wharf-boat . as that part of the promenad happen to be shelter from the steamer 's light , she was see the panorama of sutherland -- it long stretch of shade waterfront , it cupola and steepl , the wide leafi street lead straight from the river by a gentl slope to the base of the dark tower bluff behind the town -- all sleep in peac and beauti in the soft light of the moon . that farthest cupola to the left -- it was the number two engin hous , and the third place from it was her uncl 's hous . slowli the steamer , now in mid-stream , drew away from the town . one by one the familiar landmark -- the pack hous , the soap factori , the geiss breweri , the tall chimney of the pump station , the shorn top of reservoir hill -- slip ghostlili away to the southwest . the sob choke up into her throat and the tear rain from her eye . they all piti and look down on her there ; still , it had been home the onli home she ever had known or ever would know . and until these last few fright day , how happi she had been there ! for the first time she felt desol , weak , afraid . but not daunt . it is strang to see in strong human charact the strength and the weak , two flat contradict , exist side by side and make weak what seem so strong and make strong what seem so weak . howev , human charact is a tangl of inconsist , as disord and inchoat as the tangibl and visibl part of natur . susan felt weak , but not the kind of weak that skulk . and there lay the differ , the abysm differ , between courag and cowardic . courag has full as much fear as cowardic , often more ; but it has a someth els that cowardic has not . it trembl and shiver but goe forward . wipe her eye she went back to her own cabin . she had neglect close it other door , the one from the saloon . the clerk was stand smirk in the doorway . `` you must be go away for quit some time , '' said he . and he fix upon her as greedi and impud eye as ever look from a common face . it was his battl glanc . guil women , bent on trim him for anyth from a piec of plate jewelri to a saucer of ice cream , had led him to believ that befor it wall of virtu totter and fell like jericho 's befor the trumpet of joshua . `` it make me a littl homesick to see the old town disappear , '' hastili explain susan , recov herself . the instant anyon was watch , her emot alway hid . `` would n't you like to sit out on deck a while ? '' pursu the clerk , bring up a win smile to reinforc the fetch stare . the idea was attract , for she did not feel like sleep . it would be fine to sit out in the open , watch the moon and the star , the mysteri bank glide swift by , and new vista alway widen out ahead . but not with this puni , sandi littl '' river charact , '' not with anybodi that night . `` no , '' repli she . `` i think i ll go to bed .

'' she felt rest and hungri -- raven hungri . she tuck in her blous , wash as well as she could in the tini bowl on the littl washstand . then befor the cloudi watermark mirror she arrang her scarc muss hair . a charm vision of fresh young loveli , strong , erect , healthi , bright of eye and of cheek , she made as , after a furtiv look up and down the saloon , she step from her door a veri few minut after the crash of that gong . with much scuffl and bustl the passeng , most of them countri peopl , were hurri into place at the tabl which now had their extens leav and were cover with coars white tablecloth and with dish of nick stonewar , white , inde , but shabbili so . but susan 's young eye were not critic . to her it all seem fine , with the rich flavor of adventur . a more experienc travel might have been fill with gloomi forebod by the qualiti of the odor from the cook . she found it delight and sympath with the unrestrain eager of the home countri face about her , with the children beat their spoon on their empti plate . the color waiter present began to stream in , each wear a soil white jacket , each bear aloft a huge tray on which were stack fill dish and steam cup . color peopl have a keen instinct for class . one of the waiter happen to note her , advanc bow and smile with that good-humor , unservil courtesi which is the peculiar possess of the american color race . he flourish her into a chair with a `` good morn , miss . it 's go to be a fine day . '' and as soon as she was seat he began to form round her plate a larg inclos arc of side dish -- fri fish , fri steak , fri egg , fri potato , wheat cake , can peach , a cup of coffe . he drew toward her a can of syrup , a pitcher of cream , and a bowl of granul sugar . `` anyth els ?

'' she rose , went into the nearest passageway between saloon and promenad , stealthili took a ten-cent piec from her pocketbook . she call her waiter and gave it to him . she was blush deepli , frighten lest this the first tip she had ever given or seen given be misunderstood and refus . `` i 'm so much oblig , '' she said . `` you were veri nice . '' the waiter bow like a princ , alway with his simpl , friend smile ; the tip disappear under his apron . `` nobodi could help be nice to you , ladi . '' she thank him again and went to the promenad . it seem to her that they had almost arriv . along shore stretch a continu line of hous -- pretti hous with garden . there were electr car . nearer the river lay sever parallel line of railway track along which train after train was speed , some of them short train of ordinari day coach , other long train made up in part of coach grander and more beauti than ani she had ever seen . she knew they must be the parlor and dine and sleep car she had read about . and now they were in the midst of a fleet of steamer and barg , and far ahead loom the first of cincinnati 's big suspens bridg , pictur of which she had mani a time gaze at in wonder . there was a mingl of strang loud nois -- whistl , engin , on the water , on shore ; there was a multitud of what seem to her feverish activ -- she who had not been out of quiet sutherland sinc she was a babi too young to note thing . the river , the shore , grew more and more crowd . susan 's eye dart from one new object to anoth ; and eager though she look she felt she was miss more than she saw . `` whi , susan lenox ! '' exclaim a voic almost in her ear . she close her teeth upon a cri ; sudden she was back from wonderland to herself . she turn to face dumpi , dressi mrs. waterburi and her husband with the glossi kinki ringlet and the long wavi mustach . `` how do you do ? '' she stammer . `` we did n't know you were aboard , '' said mrs. waterburi , a silli , duck-leg woman look proud uncomfort in her bead-trim black silk . `` yes -- i 'm -- i 'm here , '' confess susan . `` go to the citi to visit ?

'' `` what eleg breakfast they do serv on these boat ! i suppos your friend ll meet you . but mort and i ll look after you till they come . '' `` oh , it is n't necessari , '' protest susan . the steamer was pass under the bridg . there were citi on both shore -- huge mass of dingi brick , street fill with motion of everi kind -- alway motion , incess motion , and chang . `` we re about there , are n't we ? '' she ask . `` the wharf 's up beyond the second bridg -- the covington bridg , '' explain waterburi with the air of the old experienc globe-trott . `` there 's a third one , further up , but you can't see it for the smoke . '' and he went on and on , volubl air his intim knowledg of the great citi which he visit onc a year for two or three day to buy good . he end with a scorn , `` my , but cincinnati 's a dirti place ! '' dirti it might be , but susan love it , dirt and all . the smoke , the grime somehow seem part of it , one of it charm , one of the thing that made it differ from , and superior to , monoton countri and countri town . she edg away from the waterburi , hid in her stateroom watch the panorama through the curtain glass of her promenad deck door . she was complet carri away . the citi ! so , this was the citi ! and her dream of travel , of new sight , new face , were begin to come true . she forgot herself , forgot what she had left behind , forgot what she was to face . all her power of thought and feel was use up in absorb these unfold wonder . and when the june sun sudden pierc the heavi cloud of fog and smoke , she clasp her hand and gasp , `` love ! oh , how love ! '' and now the steamer was at the huge wharf-boat , in shape like the one at sutherland , but in compar size like the real noah 's ark besid a toy ark . and from the whole tremend scene rose an enorm clamor , the stentorian voic of the citi . that voic is discord and terrifi to mani . to susan , on that day , it was the most splendid burst of music . `` awak -- awak ! '' it cri . `` awak , and _live ! _ '' she open her door that she might hear it better -- rattl and rumbl and roar , shriek of whistl , clang of bell . and the peopl ! -- thousand on thousand hurri hither and yon , like bee in a hive . `` awak awak , and live ! '' the nois from the saloon remind her that the journey was end , that she must leav the boat . and she did not know where to go -- she and her bundl . she wait until she saw the waterburi , along with the other passeng , move up the leve . then she issu forth -- by the promenad deck door so that she would not pass the offic . but at the head of the companionway , in the forward part of the deck , there the clerk stood , look even pettier and more offens by daylight . she thought to slip by him . but he stop stroke his mustach and call out to her , `` have n't your friend come ? '' she frown , angri in her nervous . `` i shall get on veri well , '' she said curt . then she repent , smile polit , ad , `` thank you . '' `` i ll put you in a carriag , '' he offer , hasten down the stair to join her . she did not know what to say or do . she walk silent besid him , he carri her bundl . they cross the wharf-boat . a line of dilapid look carriag was drawn up near the end of the gangplank . the sight of them , the remembr of what she had heard of the expens of citi carriag , nerv her to desper . `` give me my thing , pleas , '' she said . `` i think i'll walk . '' `` where do you want to go ? '' the question took her breath away . with a quick that amaz her , her lip utter , `` the gibson hous . '' `` oh ! that 's a right smart piec . but you can take a car . i ll walk with you to the car . there 's a line a coupl of squar up that goe almost by the door . you know it is n't far from fourth street . '' she was now in a flutter of terror . she went stumbl along besid him , not hear a word of his volubl and flirtati talk . they were in the midst of the mad rush and confus . the nois , no longer mingl but individu , smote savag upon her ear , startl her , make her look daze round as if expect death to swoop upon her . at the corner of fourth street the clerk halt . he was clear out of humor with her , so dumb , so unappreci . `` there ll be a car along soon , '' said he sour . `` you need n't wait , '' said she timid . `` thank you again . '' `` you ca n't miss it . good-bi . '' and he lift his hat -- '' tip '' it , rather -- for he would not have wast a full lift upon such a femal . she gave a gasp of relief when he depart ; then a gasp of terror -- for upon the opposit corner stood the waterburi . the globe-trott and his wife were so daze by the citi that they did not see her , though in their helpless glanc round they look straight at her . she hastili ran into a drug store on the corner . a young man in shirt sleev held up by pink garter , and with oili black hair care part and plaster , put down a pestl and mortar and came forward . he had kind brown eye , but there was someth wrong with the lower part of his face . susan did not dare look to see what it was , lest he should think her unfeel . he was behind the counter . susan saw the soda fountain . as if by inspir , she said , '' some chocol soda , pleas . '' `` ice cream ? '' ask the young man in a peculiar voic , like that of one who has a harelip . `` pleas , '' said susan . and then she saw the sign , `` ice cream , ten cent , '' and wish she had n't . the young man mix the soda , put in a liber help of ice cream , set it befor her with a spoon in it , rest the knuckl of his brown hairi hand on the counter and said : '' it _is_ hot .

'' `` you might leav it here with me , '' said the young man . `` that about our biggest line of trade -- that and postag stamp and telephon -- _and_ the directori . `` he laugh heartili . susan did not see whi ; she did not like the sound , either , for the young man 's deform of lower jaw deform his laughter as well as his speech . howev , she smile polit and ate and drank her soda slowli . `` i ll be glad to take care of your bundl , '' the young man said present . `` ever been here befor ? '' `` no , '' said susan . `` that is , not sinc i was about four year old . '' `` i was four , '' said the young man , `` when a hors step on my mouth in the street . '' `` my , how dread ! '' exclaim susan . `` you can see some of the scar yet , '' the young man assur her , and he point to his curious sunken mouth . `` the doctor said it was the most remark case of the kind on record , '' continu he proud . `` that was what led me into the medic line . you do n't seem to have your board hous pick .

'' he was look at her with kind curios . `` if i was you , i 'd go back home -- and wait . '' susan shrank within herself . `` i ca n't do that , '' she said . the young man thought awhil , then said : `` if you should go to my aunt 's , you can say mr. ellison sent you . no , that ai n't me . it 's the boss . you see , a respect board hous ask for refer . '' susan color deepli and her gaze slowli sank . `` i did n't know that , '' she murmur . `` do n't be afraid . aunt kate ai n't so particular -- leastway , not in summer when thing is slow . and i know you re quiet . '' by the time the soda was finish , the young man -- who said his name was robert wyli -- had written on the back of ellison busi card in a spencerian hand : `` mrs. kate wyli , 347 west sixth street . '' he explain that susan was to walk up two squar and take the car go west ; the conductor would let her off at the right place . `` you 'd better leav your thing here , '' said mr. wyli , hold up the card so that they could admir his penmanship togeth . `` you may not hit it off with aunt kate . do n't think you ve got to stay there just becaus of me . '' `` i 'm sure i ll like it , '' susan declar confid . her spirit were high ; she felt that she was in a strong run of luck . wyli lift her packag over the counter and went to the door with her to point out the direct . `` this is fourth . the next up is fifth . the next wide one is sixth -- and you can read it on the lamp-post , too . '' `` is n't that conveni ! '' exclaim susan . `` what a love citi this is !

'' and in this , as in all her thought and action sinc leav , she show confid not becaus she was conceit , but becaus she had not the remotest notion what she was actual attempt . how mani of us get credit for courag as we walk unconcern through peril , or essay and conquer great obstacl , when in truth we are not courag but simpli unawar ! as a rule knowledg is power or , rather , a sourc of power , but there are time when ignor is a power and knowledg a weak . if susan had known , she might perhap have stay at home and submit and , with crush spirit , might have sunk under the sens of shame and degrad . but she did not know ; so columbus befor his sailor or caesar at the rubicon among his soldier did not seem more tranquil than she realli was . wyli , who suspect in the direct of the truth , wonder at her . `` she 's game , she is , '' he mutter again and again that morn . `` what a nerv for a kid -- and a ladi , too ! '' she found the right corner and the right car without further adventur ; and the conductor assur her that he would set her down befor the veri door of the address on the card . it was an open car with few passeng . she took the middl of the long seat nearest the rear platform and look about her like one in a happi dream . on and on and yet on they went . with everi squar they pass more peopl , so it seem to her , than there were in all sutherland . and what huge store ! and what wonder display of thing to wear ! where would the peopl be found to buy such quantiti , and where would they get the money to pay ? how mani restaur and saloon ! whi , everybodi must be eat and drink all the time . and at each corner she look up and down the cross street , and there were more and ever more magnific build , throng upon throng of peopl . was there no end to it ? this was sixth street , still sixth street , as she saw at the corner lamp-post . then there must be five more such street between this and the river ; and she could see , up the cross street , that the citi was even vaster in the direct of the hill . and there were all these cross street ! it was stupefi -- overwhelm -- incred . she began to be nervous , they were go so far . she glanc anxious at the conductor . he was watch her interest , understood her glanc , answer it with a reassur nod . he call out : '' i 'm look out for you , miss . i ve got you on my mind . don't you fret . '' she gave him a bright smile of relief . they were pass through a doubl row of what seem to her state resid , and there were few peopl on the sidewalk . the air , too , was clearer , though the wall were grimi and also the grass in the occasion tini front yard . but the curtain at the window look clean and fresh , and so did the better class of peopl among those on the sidewalk . it delight her to see so mani well-dress women , wear their cloth with an air which she told herself she must acquir . she was startl by the conductor 's call out : '' now , miss ! '' she rose as he rang the bell and was readi to get off when the car stop , for she was eager to caus him as littl troubl as possibl . `` the hous is right straight befor you , '' said the conductor . `` the number 's in the transom . '' she thank him , descend , was on the sidewalk befor mrs. wyli 's . she look at the hous and her heart sank . she thought of the small sum in her purs ; it was most unlik that such a hous as this would harbor her . for here was a grand stone stairway ascend to a deep stone portico , and within it great door , bigger than those of the wright mansion , the palac of sutherland . howev , she recal the humbl appear and mode of speech of her friend the drug clerk and pluck up the courag to ascend and to ring . a slattern , color maid open the door . at the first glanc within , at the first whiff of the interior air , susan felt more at eas . for she was see what even her bedazzl eye recogn as cheap dowdi , and the smell that assail her nostril was that of a hous bad and poor kept -- the smell of cheap food and bad butter cook , of cat , of undust room , of various unrecogniz kind of stale . she stood in the center of the big dingi parlor , gaze round at the grime chromo until mrs. wyli enter -- a thin middle-ag woman with small brown eye set wide apart , a perpetu frown , and a chin so long and so project that she was almost jimber-jaw . while susan explain stammer what she had come for , mrs. wyli eye her with increas disfavor . when susan had finish , she unlock her lip for the first time to say : '' the room 's took . '' `` oh ! '' cri susan in dismay . the telephon rang in the back parlor . mrs. wyli excus herself to answer . after a few word she close the door between . she was gone fulli five minut ; to susan it seem an hour . she came back , say : '' i ve been talk to my nephew . he call up . well , i reckon you can have the room . it ai n't my custom to take in ladi as young as you . but you seem to be all right . your parent allow you to come ? '' `` i have n't ani , '' repli susan . `` i 'm here to find a place and support myself . '' mrs. wyli continu to eye her dubious . `` well , i have no wish to pri into your affair . mind your own busi , ' that 's my rule . '' she spoke with defianc , as if the contrari were be assert by some invis person who might appear and gain hear and belief . she went on : `` if mr. ellison want it , whi i suppos it 's all right . but you ca n't stay out later'n ten o'clock . '' `` i sha n't go out at all of night , '' said susan eager . `` you _look_ quiet , '' said mrs. wyli , with the air of ad that appear were rare other than decept . `` oh , i _am_ quiet , '' declar susan . it puzzl her , this recurr of the suggest of noisi . `` i ca n't allow much compani -- none in your room . '' `` there wo n't be ani compani . '' she blush deepli . `` that is , a -- a young man from our town -- he may call onc . but he ll be off for the east right away . '' mrs. wyli reflect on this , susan the while stand uneasili , dread lest decis would be against her . final mrs. wyli said : '' robert say you want the five-dollar room . i ll show it to you . '' they ascend two flight through increas shabbi . on the third floor at the rear was a room -- a mere continu of the narrow hall , partit off . it contain a small fold bed , a small tabl , a tini bureau , a washstand hard as larg as that in the cabin on the boat , a row of hook with a curtain of flower chintz befor them , a kitchen chair , a chromo of `` awak and asleep , '' a torn and dirti rag carpet . the odor of the room , stale , damp , verg on moldi , seem the fit exhal from such an assemblag of forbid object . `` it 's a nice , comfort room , '' said mrs. wyli aggress . `` i could n't afford to give it and two meal for five dollar except till the first of septemb . after that it 's eight . '' `` i ll be glad to stay , if you ll let me , '' said susan . mrs. wyli 's suspicion , so plain in those repel eye , took all the courag out of her . the great adventur seem rapid to be lose it charm . she could not think of herself as content or anyth but sad and depress in such surround as these . how much better it would be if she could live out in the open , out where it was attract ! `` i suppos you ve got some baggag , '' said mrs. wyli , as if she rather expect to hear that she had not . `` i left it at the drug store , '' explain susan . `` your trunk ? '' susan start nervous at that explos exclam . `` i -- i have n't got a trunk -- onli a few thing in a shawl strap . '' `` well , i never ! '' mrs. wyli toss her head , cluck her tongu disgust against the roof of her mouth . `` but i suppos if mr. ellison say so , whi you can stay . '' `` thank you , '' said susan humbl . even if it would not have been basest ingratitud to betray her friend , mr. wyli , still she would not have had the courag to confess the truth about mr. ellison and so get herself order into the street . `` i -- i think i ll go for my thing . '' `` the custom is to pay in advanc , '' said mrs. wyli sharpli . `` oh , yes -- of cours , '' stammer susan . she seat herself on the wooden chair and open out her purs . she found the five among her few bill , extend it with trembl finger toward mrs. wyli . at the same time she lift her eye . the woman 's express as she bore into the pocketbook terrifi her . never befor had she seen the savag greedi that is bred in the citi among the peopl who fight against fear odd to maintain their respect and to save themselv from the ever threaten drop to the despis work class . `` thank you , '' said mrs. wyli , take the bill as if she were confer a favor upon susan . `` i make everybodi pay prompt . the first of the week or out they go ! i use to be easi and i came near go down .

'' and the woman whom the men had all her life been help to their uttermost not to `` forget herself '' look sharp suspicion and envi at susan , the love . whi are women of the mrs. wyli sort so swift to suspect ? can it be that in some secret chamber of their never assail heart there lurk a long -- a feel as to what they would do if they had the chanc ? mrs. wyli continu , `` i hope you have strict christian principl ?

'' susan escap from the hous as speedili as her fli feet would take her down the two flight . in the street onc more , her spirit rose . she went south to fourth street , decid to walk instead of take a car . she now found herself in much more impress surround than befor , and realiz that sixth street was realli one of the minor street . the further uptown she went , the more excit she becam . after the district of state mansion with wonder carriag drive up and away and women dress like those in the illustr stori paper , came splendid shop and hotel , finer than susan had believ there were anywher in the world . and most of the peopl -- the crowd on crowd of peopl ! -- look prosper and cheer and so delight citifi ! she wonder whi so mani of the men stare at her . she assum it must be someth rural in her appear though that ought to have set the women to stare , too . but she thought littl about this , so absorb was she in see all the new thing . she walk slowli , paus to inspect the shop window -- the gorgeous dress and hat and jewelri , the thousand cost thing scatter in careless profus . and the crowd ! how secur she felt among these multitud of stranger , not one of them know or suspect her secret of shame ! she no longer had the sens of be outcast , brand . when she had gone so far that it seem to her she certain must have miss the drug store , care though she had inspect each corner as she went , she decid that she must stop someon of this hurri throng and inquir the way . while she was still screw her courag to this bold , she espi the sign and hasten joy across the street . she and wyli welcom each other like old friend . he was delight when he learn that she had taken the room . `` you wo n't mind aunt kate after a while , '' said he . `` she 's sour and nosey , but she 's honest and respect -- and that 's the main thing just now with you . and i think you ll get a job all right . aunt kate 's got a ladi friend that 's head salesladi at shillito 's . she ll know of someth . '' wyli was so kind and so hope that susan felt alreadi settl . as soon as custom came in , she took her parcel and went , wyli say , `` i ll drop round after supper and see how thing are get on .

'' and he reenter the hous . what a mysteri cruel world ! could it be the same world she had live in so happili all the year until a few day ago -- the same she had alway found `` god 's beauti world , '' full of gentl and kind ? and whi had it chang ? what was this sin that after a long sleep in her mother 's grave had risen to poison everyon against her ? and whi had it risen ? it was all beyond her . she stroll wretch within bound , with a forebod of impend evil . she watch lew in the garden ; she got her aunt to let her help with the churn -- drive the dasher monoton up and down until the butter came ; then she help work the butter , help gather the veget for dinner , did everyth and anyth to keep herself from think . toward eleven o'clock her uncl zeke appear in the dining-room , call his wife from the kitchen . susan felt that at last someth was to happen . after a long time her aunt return ; there were all the evid of weep in her face . `` you 'd better go to your room and straighten it up , '' she said without look at the girl . `` the thing has air long enough , i reckon . . . . and you 'd better stay up there till i call you . '' susan had finish the room , was about to unpack the heavy-laden shawl strap and shake the wrinkl out of the skirt , fold away for two day now . she heard the sound of a hors 's hoof , went to the window . a young man whom she recogn as one of her uncl zeke 's tenant was hitch to the hors block a well-set-up young mare draw a speci of broad-seat break sulki . he had a handsom common face , a wavi black mustach . she rememb that his name was ferguson -- jeb ferguson , and that he was work on share what was known as '' the creek-bottom farm , '' which began about a mile and a half away , straight down the pastur hollow . he glanc up at the window , rais his black slouch hat , and nod with the self-consci , self-assur grin of the desir of women . she tri to return this salut with a pleasant smile . he enter the gate and she heard his boot upon the front step . now away across the hollow anoth figur appear -- a man on horseback come through the wheat field . he was ride toward the farther gate of the pastur at a leisur dignifi pace . she had onli made out that he had abund whisker when the sound of a step upon the stair caus her to turn . as that step came nearer her heart beat more and more wild . her wide eye fix upon the open door of the room . it was her uncl georg . `` sit down , '' he said as he reach the threshold . `` i want to talk to you . '' she seat herself , with hand fold in her lap . her head was ach from the beat of the blood in her templ . `` zeke and i have talk it over , '' said warham . `` and we'v decid that the onli thing to do with you is to get you settl . so in a few minut now you re go to be marri . '' her lack of express show that she did not understand . in fact , she could onli feel -- feel the cruel , contemptu anger of that voic which all her day befor had caress her . `` we ve pick out a good husband for you , '' warham continu . `` it 's jeb ferguson . '' susan quiver . `` i -- i do n't want to , '' she said . `` it ai n't a question of what you want , '' retort warham rough . he was twenty-four hour and a night 's sleep away from his first fierc outblaz of furi -- away from the influenc of his wife and his daughter . if it had not been for his brother zeke , narrow and cold , the event might have been differ . but zeke was there to keep his `` sens of duti '' strong . and that he might nerv himself and hide and put down ani tendenc to be a '' soft-heart fool '' -- a tendenc that threaten to grow as he look at the girl -- the child -- he assum the roughest manner he could muster . `` it ai n't a question of what you want , '' he repeat . `` it 's a question of what 's got to be done , to save my famili and you , too -- from disgrac . we ai n't go to have ani more bastard in this famili . '' the word meant noth to the girl . but the sound of it , as her uncl pronounc it , made her feel as though the blood were dri up in her vein . `` we ai n't go to take ani chanc , '' pursu warham , less rough ; for now that he had look the situat full and frank in the face , he had no nerv to brace himself . the necess of what he was prepar to do and to make her do was too obvious . `` ferguson 's here , and zeke saw the preacher we sent for ride in from the main road . so i ve come to tell you . if you 'd like to fix up a littl , whi your aunt salli ll be here in a minut . you want to pray god to make you a good wife . and you ought to be thank you have sensibl relat to step in and save you from yourself . '' susan tri to speak ; her voic die in her throat . she made anoth effort . `` i do n't want to , '' she said . `` then what do you want to do -- tell me that ! '' exclaim her uncl , rough again . for her manner was veri move , the more so becaus there was none of the usual appeal to piti and to merci . she was silent . `` there is n't anyth els for you to do . '' `` i want to -- to stay here . '' `` do you think zeke 'd harbor you -- when you re about certain to up and disgrac us as your mother did ? '' `` i have n't done anyth wrong , '' said the girl dulli . `` do n't you dare lie about that ! '' `` i ve seen ruth do the same with arti sinclair -- and all the girl with differ boy . '' `` you miser girl ! '' cri her uncl . `` i never heard it was so dread to let a boy kiss you . '' `` do n't pretend to be innoc . you know the differ between that and what you did ! '' susan realiz that when she had kiss sam she had realli love him . perhap that was the fatal differ . and her mother -- the sin there had been that she realli love while the man had n't . yes , it must be so . ruth 's explan of these mysteri had been differ ; but then ruth had also admit that she knew littl about the matter -- and susan most doubt the part that ruth had assur her was certain true . `` i did n't know , '' said susan to her uncl . `` nobodi ever told me . i thought we were engag . '' `` a good woman do n't need to be told , '' retort warham . `` but i'm not go to argu with you . you ve got to marri . '' `` i could n't do that , '' said the girl . `` no , i could n't . '' `` you ll either take him or you go back to sutherland and i'll have you lock up in the jail till you can be sent to the hous of correct . you can take your choic . '' susan sat look at her slim brown hand and interlac her long finger . the jail ! the hous of correct was dread enough , for though she had never seen it she had heard what it was for , what kind of boy and girl live there . but the jail -- she had seen the jail , back behind the courthous , with it air of mysteri and of horror . not hell itself seem such a fright thing as that jail . `` well -- which do you choos ? '' said her uncl in a sharp voic . the girl shiver . `` i do n't care what happen to me , '' she said , and her voic was dull and sullen and hard . `` and it doe n't much matter , '' sneer warham . everi time he look at her his anger flame again at the outrag to his love , his trust , his honor , and the impend danger of more illegitimaci . `` marri jeb will give you a chanc to reform and be a good woman . he understand -- so you need n't be afraid of what he ll find out . '' `` i do n't care what happen to me , '' the girl repeat in the same monoton voic . warham rose . `` i ll send your aunt salli , '' said he . `` and when i call , she ll bring you down . '' the girl 's silenc , her non-resist the aw express of her still featur -- made him uneasi . he went to the window instead of to the door . he glanc furtiv at her ; but he might have glanc open as there was n't the least danger of meet her eye . `` you re marri about as well as you could have hope to , anyhow -- better , probabl , '' he observ , in an argument , defens tone . `` zeke say jeb 's about the likeliest young fellow he know -- a likeli fellow than either zeke or i was at his age . i ve given him two thousand dollar in cash . that ought to start you off well . '' and he went out without ventur anoth look at her . her youth and helpless , her stoni miseri , were again make it harder for him to hold himself to what he and the fanat zeke had decid to be his duti as a christian , as a father , as a guardian . besid , he did not dare face his wife and his daughter until the whole busi was settl respect and final . his sister-in-law was wait in the next room . as soon as his descent clear the way she hurri in . from the threshold she glanc at the girl ; what she saw sent her hurri out to recompos herself . but the instant she again saw that express of mute and daze despair the tear fought for releas . the effort to suppress outward sign of piti made her plain fat face grotesqu . she could not speak . with a corner of her apron she wipe imaginari dust from the glass bell that protect the artifici flower . the poor child ! and all for no fault of her -- and becaus she had been born out of wedlock . but then , the old woman reflect , was it not one of the most familiar of god 's mysteri way that peopl were punish most sever of all for the thing that were n't their fault -- for be born in shame , or in bad or low famili , or sick , or for be stupid or ugli or ignor ? she envi zeke -- his unwav belief in religion . she believ , but her tender heart was alway lead her into doubt . she at last got some sort of control over her voic . `` it ll turn out for the best , '' she said , with her back to susan . `` it don't make much differ nohow who a woman marri , so long as he steadi and a good provid . jeb seem to be a nice feller . he better look than your uncl georg was befor he went to town and marri a lenox and got sleek up . and jeb ai n't near so close as some . that 's a lot in a husband . '' and in a kind of hysteria , bred of fear of silenc just then , she rattl on , tell how this man lay awak o ' night think how to skin a flea for it hide and tallow , how that one had said onli a fool would pay over a quarter for a new hat for his wife -- -- '' will it be long ? '' ask the girl . `` i ll go down and see , '' said mrs. warham , glad of a real excus for leav the room . she began to cri as soon as she was in the hall . two sparrow lit upon the window sill near susan and scream and peck at each other in a mock fight . she watch them ; but her shiver at the faint sound of her aunt 's return step far away down the stair show where her attent was . when zeke 's wife enter she was stand and said : '' is it time ? '' `` come on , honey . now do n't be afraid . '' susan advanc with a firm step , preced her aunt down the stair . the black slouch hat and the straw of dignifi cut were side by side on the shini hall tabl . the parlor door was open ; the rare use showroom gave forth an earthi , moldi odor like that of a disturb grave . it shutter , for the first time in perhap a year , were open ; the mud dauber that had built in the crevic between shutter and sill , fanci they would never be disturb , were buzz crossli about their ruin home . the four men were seat , each with his leg cross , and each wear the funer express befit a solemn occas . susan did not lift her eye . the profus whisker man seat on the haircloth sofa smooth his black alpaca coat , reset the black tie deep hid by his beard , rose and advanc with a cleric smile whose real kindli took somewhat from it offens unction . `` this is the young ladi , is it ? '' said he , reach for susan 's rise but listless hand . `` she is inde a _young_ ladi ! '' the two warham men stood , shift uneasili from leg to leg and rub their face from time to time . salli warham was stand also , her big unhealthi face twitch fantast . jeb alon was seat -- chair tilt back , hand in trouser pocket , a bucol grin of embarrass give an express of pain to his common featur . a strain silenc , then zeke warham said : '' i reckon we might as well go ahead . '' the preacher took a small black-bound book from the insid pocket of his limp and dusti coat , clear his throat , turn over the page . that rustl , the creak of his collar on his overstarch shirt band , and the buzz of the mud dauber round the window were the onli sound . the preacher found the place , clear his throat again . `` mr. ferguson -- -- '' jeb , tall , spare , sallow , rose awkwardly. '' -- you and miss lenox will take your place here -- -- '' and he indic a posit befor him . susan was alreadi in place ; jeb shuffl up to stand at her left . salli warham hid her face in her apron . the preacher clear his throat vigor , began -- '' dear belov '' -- and so on and on . when he put the question to susan and jeb he told them what answer was expect , and they obey him , jeb mutter , susan with a mere , movement of the lip . when he had finish -- a matter of less than three minut -- he shook hand warm first with susan , then with jeb . `` live in the fear of the lord , '' he said . `` that 's all that 's necessari . '' salli put down her apron . her face was haggard and gray . she kiss susan tender , then led her from the room . they went upstair to the bedroom . `` do you want to stay to dinner ? '' she ask in the hoars underton of funer occas . `` or would you rather go right away ? '' `` i 'd rather go , '' said the girl . `` you set down and make yourself comfort . i ll hook up your shawl strap . '' susan sat by the window , her hand in her lap . the hand with the new circlet of gold on it was uppermost . salli busi herself with the bundl ; abrupt she threw her apron over her face , knelt by the bed and sob and utter inarticul moan . the girl made no sound , did not move , look unse at her inert hand . a few moment and salli set to work again . she soon had the bundl readi , brought susan 's hat , put it on . `` it 's so hot , i reckon you ll carri your jacket . i ai n't seen as pretti a blue dress as this -- yet it 's plain-lik , too . '' she went to the top of the stair . `` she want to go , jeb , '' she call loud . `` you 'd better get the sulki readi . '' the answer from below was the heavi thump of jeb 's boot on the oilcloth cover of the hall floor . susan , from the window , dulli watch the young farmer unhitch the mare and lead her up in front of the gate . `` come on , honey , '' said aunt salli , take up the bundl . the girl -- she seem a child now -- follow her . on the front stoop were georg and his brother and the preacher . the men made room for them to pass . salli open the gate ; susan went out . `` you ll have to hold the bundl , '' said salli . susan mount to the seat , took the bundl on her knee . jeb , who had the line , left the mare 's head and got up besid his bride . `` good day , all , '' he said , nod at the men on the stoop . `` good day , mrs . warham . '' `` come and see us real soon , '' said salli . her fat chin was quiver ; her tired-look , washed-out eye gaze mourn at the girl who was act and look as if she were walk in her sleep . `` good day , all , '' repeat jeb , and again he made the cluck sound . `` good-bi and god bless you , '' said the preacher . his nostril were luxuri snif the air which bore to them odor of cookeri . the mare set out . susan 's gaze rest immov upon the heavi bundl in her lap . as the road was in wretch repair , jeb whole attent was upon his drive . at the gate between barnyard and pastur he said , `` you hold the line while i get down . '' susan 's finger close mechan upon the strip of leather . jeb led the mare through the gate , close it , resum his seat . this time the mare went on without exact the cluck sound . they were follow the rocki road along the wester hillsid of the pastur hollow . as they slowli made their way among the deep rut and bowlder , from frequent moisten of the lip and throat , nois , and twitch of bodi and hand , it was evid that the young farmer was get readi for convers . the struggl at last broke surfac with , `` zeke warham do n't wast no time road patchin ' -- doe he ? '' susan did not answer . jeb studi her out of the corner of his eye , the first time a fair good bit of roadway permit . he could make noth of her face except that it was about the prettiest he had ever seen . plain she was not eager to get acquaint ; still , acquaint they must get . so he tri again : '' my sister keziah -- she keep hous for me -- she ll be mighti surpris when i turn up with a wife . i did n't let on to her what i was about , nari a word .

'' jeb look at her with a smile and a frown . `` perk up a littl , '' he more than half order . `` i do n't want keziah jeerin ' at me . '' susan made a piti effort to smile . he eye it sour , grunt , gave the mare a cut with the whip that caus her to leap forward in a gallop . `` whoa ! '' he yell . `` whoa -- damn you ! '' and he saw cruelli at her mouth until she quiet down . a turn and they were befor a shallow story-and-a-half frame hous which squat like an old roadsid beggar behind a weather-beaten picket fenc . the sag shingl roof slope abrupt ; there were four littl window downstair and two smaller upstair . the door was in the center of the hous ; a weedi path led from it crook step , between two patch of weedi grass , to the gate in the fenc . `` whoa ! '' shout jeb , with the doubl purpos of stop the mare and inform the hous of his arriv . then to susan : `` you git down and i ll drive round to the barn yonder . '' he nod toward a dilapid clapboard structur , small and mean , set between a dirti lopsid straw heap and a manur heap . `` go right in and make yourself at home . tell keziah who you air . i ll be along , soon as i unhitch and feed the mare . '' susan was stare stupid at the hous -- at her new home . `` git down , '' he said sharpli . `` you do n't act as if your hearin or your manner was much to brag on . '' he felt awkward and embarrass with this delic bred , love child-woman in the , to him , wonder fine and fashion dress . to hide his nervous and to brave it out , he took the onli way he knew , the onli way shi peopl usual know -- the way of gruff . it was not a feroci gruff for a man of his kind ; but it seem so to her who had been use to gentl onli , until these last few day . his grammar , his untrain voic , his rough cloth , the odor of stale sweat and farm labor he exhal , made him horribl to her -- though she onli vagu knew whi she felt so wretch and whi her bodi shrank from him . she step down from the sulki , almost fall in her dizzi and blind . jeb touch the mare with the whip and she was alon befor the hous -- a sweet forlorn figur , childish , utter out of place in those surround . on the threshold , in fade and patch calico , stood a tall gaunt woman with a famili like to jeb . she had thin shini black hair , a hard brown skin , high cheekbon and snap black eye . when her thin lip part she show on the left side of the mouth three larg and glitter gold teeth that in the contrast made their gray , not too clean neighbor seem white . `` howdi ! '' she call in a tone of hostil . susan tri in vain to respond . she stood gaze . `` what d ye want ? '' `` he he told me to go in , '' falter susan . she had no sens of realiti . it was a dream -- onli a dream -- and she would awaken in her own clean pretti pale-gray bedroom with ruth gayli call her to come down to breakfast . `` who are you ? '' demand keziah -- for at a glanc it was the sister . `` i 'm -- i 'm susan lenox . '' `` oh -- zeke warham 's niec . come right in . '' and keziah look as if she were about to bite and claw . susan push open the latchless gate , went up the short path to the doorstep . `` i think i ll wait till he come , '' she said . `` no . come in and sit down , miss lenox . '' and keziah drew a rush-bottom rock chair toward the doorway . susan was look at the interior . the lower floor of the hous was divid into three small room . this central room was obvious the parlor -- the calico-cov sofa , the center tabl , the two dingi chromo , and a batter cottag organ made that certain . on the floor was a rag carpet ; on the wall , torn and dirti paper , with huge weather stain mark where water had leak from the roof down the support beam . keziah scowl at susan 's frank express of repuls for the surround . susan seat herself on the edg of the chair , put her bundl besid her . `` i allow you ll stay to dinner , '' said keziah . `` yes , '' repli susan . `` then i ll go put on some more to cook . '' `` oh , no -- pleas do n't -- i could n't eat anyth -- realli , i could n't .

'' keziah blew out her breath in a great gust and seat herself on the tatter calico cover of the sofa . susan grew death white . her hand trembl . then she sat quiet upon the edg of the old rush-bottom chair . there was a terribl silenc , broken by jeb 's say loud and fierc , `` keziah , you go get the dinner . then you pack your dud and clear out for uncl bob 's .

'' jeb , not care to provok the `` ferguson temper , '' said noth . `` as for this here marryin ' , '' continu keziah , `` i never allow you 'd fall so low as to take a babi , and a bastard at that . '' she whirl away . jeb flung his hat on the tabl , flung himself on the sofa . `` well -- that 's settl , '' said he . `` you kin get the dinner . it 's all in there . '' and he jerk his head toward the door in the partit to the left . susan got up , move toward the indic door . jeb laugh . `` do n't you think you might take off your hat and stay awhil ? '' said he . she remov her hat , put it on top of the bundl which she left on the floor besid the rock chair . she went into the kitchen dining-room . it was a squalid room , it ceil and wall smoke-stain from the crack and never polish stove in the corner . the air was foul with the strong old onion stew on the stove . in a skillet slice of pork were fri . on the back of the stove stood a pan of mash potato and a tin coffeepot . on the stain flower cloth which cover the tabl in the middl of the room had been laid coars , crack dish and discolor steel knive and fork with black wooden handl . susan , half faint , drop into a chair by one of the open window . a multitud of fat fli from the stabl were run and crawl everywher , were buzz about her head . she was arous by jeb 's voic : `` whi , what the -- the damnat ! you'v fell asleep !

'' `` i 'm not hungri , '' said susan . then , as he frown suspici , '' i had a late breakfast .

'' and he wink again . the girl , ghast white , her great eye stare like a sleepwalk 's , rose and stood rest one hand on the back of the chair to steadi her . jeb drew a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and light it . `` usual , '' said he , `` i take a pipe or a chaw . but this bein ' a weddin ' day -- -- '' he laugh and wink again , rose , took her in his arm and kiss her . she made a feebl gestur of thrust him away . her head reel , her stomach turn . she got away as soon as he would releas her , cross the sitting-room and enter the tini dingi bedroom . the window were down and the bed had not yet been made . the odor was nauseat -- the stale left by a not too clean sleeper who abhor fresh air . susan saw the box under the bed , knelt to draw it out . but instead she buri her face in her hand , burst into wild sob . `` oh , god , '' she pray , `` stop punish me . i didn't mean to do wrong -- and i 'm sure my mother did n't , either . stop , for thi son 's sake , amen . '' now sure she would wake . god must answer that prayer . she dare not take her palm from her eye . sudden she felt herself caught from behind . she gave a wild scream and sprang up . jeb was look at her with eye that fill her with a fear more aw than the fear of death . `` do n't ! '' she cri . `` do n't ! '' `` never mind , hon , '' said he in a voic that was terribl just becaus it was soft . `` it 's onli your husband . my , but you'r purti ! '' and he seiz her . she fought . he crush her . he kiss her with great slobber smack and gnaw at the flesh of her neck with teeth that crave to bite . `` oh , mr. ferguson , for piti 's sake ! '' she wail . then she open her mouth wide as one gasp for breath where there is no air ; and push at him with all her strength she vent a seri of maniac shriek . chapter x late that afternoon jeb return to the hous after sever hour of uneasi , aimless potter about at barn and woodsh . he stump and stamp around the kitchen , then in the sitting-room , final he muster the courag to look into the bedroom , from which he had slunk like a crimin three hour befor . there she lay , appar in the same posit . her waxen color and her absolut still ad fear to his sens of guilt -- a guilt against which he protest , becaus he felt he had simpli done what god and man expect of him . he stood in the low doorway for some time , stood there peer and crane until his fear grew so great that he could no longer put off end or confirm it . `` sleepin ' ? '' said he in a hoars underton . she did not repli ; she did not move . he could not see that she was breath . `` it ll soon be time to git supper , '' he went on -- not becaus he was think of supper but becaus he was desper clutch for someth that must draw a repli from her -- if she could repli . `` want me to clean up the dinner and put the supper thing on ? '' she made a feebl effort to rise , sank back again . he drew an audibl sigh of relief ; at least she was not what her color had suggest . in fact , she was morbid conscious . the instant she had heard him at the outer door she had begun to shiver and shake , and not until he move toward the bedroom door did she becom quiet . then a calm had come into her nerv and her flesh -- the calm that descend upon the brave when the peril actual face . as he stood there her eye were close , but the smell of him -- beneath the earthi odor of his cloth the odor of the bodi of those who eat strong , coars food -- stole into her nostril , into her nerv . her whole bodi sicken and shrank -- for to her now that odor meant marriag -- and she would not have believ hell contain or heaven permit such a thing as was marriag . she understood now whi the bibl alway talk of man as a vile creatur born in sin . jeb was stealthili watch her ghast face , her limp bodi . `` feelin ' sickish ? '' he ask . a slight movement of the head in assent . `` i kin ride over to beecamp and fetch doc christi . '' anoth and negat shake of the head , more determin . the pale lip murmur , `` no -- no , thank you . '' she was not hate him . he exist for her onli as a symbol , in this hideous dream call life , that was coil like a snake about her and was befoul her and sting her to death . `` do n't you bother bout supper , '' said he with gruff , shamefac generos . `` i ll look out for myself , this onct . '' he withdrew to the kitchen , where she heard him clatter dish and pan . daylight wane to twilight , twilight to dusk , to dark . she did not think ; she did not feel , except an occasion dull pang from some bodili bruis . her soul , her mind , were absolut numb . sudden a radianc beat upon her eye . all in an instant , befor the lift of her eyelid , soul and bodi becam exquisit acut ; for she thought it was he come again , with a lamp . she look ; it was the moon whose beam struck full in at the uncurtain window and bath her face in their mild bright . she close her eye again and present fell asleep -- the utter relax sleep of a child that is worn out with pain , when natur turn gentl nurs and set about heal and sooth as onli natur can . when she awok it was with a scream . no , she was not dream ; there was an odor in the room -- his odor , with that of a saloon ad to it . after cook and eat supper he had taken the jug from it conceal behind the woodbox and had proceed to cheer his droop spirit . the more he drank the better content he was with himself , with his conduct , and the clearer becam his convict that the girl was simpli play woman 's familiar game of dainti modesti . a proper game it was too ; onli a man must not pay attent to it unless he wish his woman to despis him . when this convict reach the point of action he put away the jug , wash the glass , ate a liber mouth of the left-ov stew onion , as he would not for world have his bride catch him tippl . he put out the lamp and went to the bedroom , chuckl to himself like a man about to play a particular clever and extrem good-humor practic joke . his prepar for the night were , as alway , extrem simpl mere a fling off of his outer cloth and , in summer , his sock . from time to time he cast an admir amor glanc at the love childlik face in the full moonlight . as he was about to stretch himself on the bed besid her he happen to note that she was dress as when she came . that stylish , sundayish dress was alreadi too much muss and wrinkl . he lean over to wake her with a kiss . it was then that she start up with a scream . `` oh -- oh -- my god ! '' she exclaim , pass her hand over her brow and stare at him with craze , anguish eye . `` it 's jest me , '' said he . `` thought you 'd want to git readi fur bed , like as not . '' `` no , thank you , no , '' she stammer , draw away toward the inner side of the bed . `` pleas i want to be as i am . '' `` now , do n't put on , sweet , '' he wheedl . `` you know you'r marri and ave got to git use to it . '' he laid his hand on her arm . she had intend to obey , sinc that was the law of god and man and sinc in all the world there was no other place for her , nameless and outcast . but at his touch she clench her teeth , cri : '' no -- mr. ferguson -- pleas -- _please_ let me be . '' `` now , hon , '' he plead , seiz her with strong gentl . `` there ai n't no call to be skittish . we re marri , you know . '' she wrench herself free . he seiz her again . `` what 's the use of puttin ' on ? i know all about you . you littl no-nam , '' he curs , when her teeth sank into his hand . for an instant , at that remind of her degrad , her indel shame that made her of the low and the vile , she collaps in weak . then with new and fierc strength she fought again . when she had exhaust herself utter she relax , fell to sob and moan , feebli tri to shelter her face from his glutton and odor kiss . and upon the scene the moon shone in all that beauti which from time immemori has fill the heart of lover with ecstasi and of devote with prayer . they lay quiet side by side ; he fell into a profound sleep . he was full upon his back , his broad chest heav in the gray cotton undershirt , his mouth wide open with it upper fring of hair in disarray and agit by his breath . soon he began to snore , a deafen clamor that set some loos object in the dark part of the room to vibrat with a tap sound . susan stealthili rais herself upon her elbow , look at him . there was neither horror nor fear in her haggard face but onli eager to be sure he would not awaken . she , inch by inch , more soft than a cat , climb over the low footboard , was stand on the floor . one silent step at a time , with eye never from his face so clear in the moonlight , she made her way toward the door . the snore stop -- and her heart stop with it . he gasp , gurgl , gave a snort , and sat up . `` what -- which -- -- '' he ejacul . then he saw her near the door . `` hello -- whar ye goin ' ? '' `` i thought i 'd undress , '' she lie , calm and smooth . `` oh -- that 's right . '' and he lay down . she stood in the dark , make now and then a faint sound suggest of undress . the snore began again -- soft , then deep , then the steadi , uproari intak with the fierc whistl exhal . she went into the sitting-room , felt round in the dark , swift and noiseless . on the sofa she found her bundl , tore it open . by feel alon she snatch her sailor hat , a few handkerchief , two stock , a collar her finger chanc upon and a toothbrush . she dart to the front door , was outsid , was glide down the path , out through the gate into the road . to the left would be the way she had come . she ran to the right , with never a backward glanc -- ran with all the speed in her lith young bodi , ran with all the energi of her fear and horror and resolv to die rather than be taken . for a few hundr yard the road lay between open field . but after that it enter a wood . and in that dim she felt the first begin of a sens of freedom . half a mile and open field again , with a small hous on the right , a road southeastward on the left . that would be away from her uncl zeke 's and also away from sutherland , which lay twenti mile to the southwest . when she would be follow jeb would not think of this direct until he had exhaust the other two . she walk , she ran , she rest ; she walk and ran and walk again . the moon ascend to the zenith , cross the level of the upper sky , went down in the west ; a long bar of duski gray outlin a cloud low upon the horizon in the northeast . she was on the verg of collaps . her skin , the insid of her mouth , were hot and dri . she had to walk along at snail 's pace or her heart would begin to beat as if it were about to burst and the blood would choke up into the vein of her throat to suffoc her . a terribl pain came in her side -- came and went -- came and stay . she had pass turn after turn , to the right , to the left -- crossroad lead away in all direct . she had kept to the main road becaus she did not wish to lose time , perhap return upon her path , in the confus of the dark . now she began to look about her at the countri . it was still the hill as round zeke warham 's -- the hill of southeastern indiana . but they were steeper and higher , for she was move toward the river . there was less open ground , more and denser undergrowth and forest . she felt that she was in a wilder , was safe . night still lay too thick upon the landscap for her to distinguish anyth but outlin . she sat down on the ruin and crumbl panel of a zigzag fenc to rest and to wait for light . she listen ; a profound hush . she was alon , all alon . how far had she come ? she could not guess ; but she knew that she had done well . she would have been amaz if she had known how well . all the year of her life , thank to mrs. warham 's good sens about health , she had been steadili ad to the vital and strength that were her by inherit . thus , the respons to this first demand upon them had been almost inevit . it augur well for the futur , if the futur should draw her into hardship . she knew she had gone far and in what was left of the night and with what was left of her strength she would put such a distanc between her and them that they would never believ she had got so far , even should they seek in this direct . she was support her head upon her hand , her elbow upon her knee . her eye close , her head nod ; she fought against the impuls , but she slept . when she straighten up with a start it was broad day . the bird must have finish their morn song , for there was onli happi , comfort chirp in the branch abov her . she rose stiffli . her leg , her whole bodi , ach ; and her feet were burn and blister . but she struck out resolut . after she had gone halfway down a long steep hill , she had to turn back becaus she had left her onli possess . it was a weari climb , and her heart quak with terror . but no one appear , and at last she was onc more at the ruin of the fenc panel . there lay her sailor hat , the handkerchief , wrap round the toothbrush , the collar -- and two stock , one black , the other brown . and where was her purs ? not there , certain . she glanc round in swift alarm . no one . yet she had been absolut sure she had taken her purs from the sitting-room tabl when she came upon it , feel about in the dark . she had forgotten it ; she was without a cent ! but she had no time to wast in self-reproach or forebod . though the stock would be of no use to her , she took them along becaus to leav them was to leav a trail . she hasten down the hill . at the bottom ran a deep creek -- without a bridg . the road was now a mere cowpath which onli the stoutest vehicl or a horseman would adventur . to her left ran an even wilder trail , follow the downward cours of the creek . she turn out of the road , enter the trail . she came to a place where the bowlder over which the creek foam and splash as it hurri southeastward were big and numer enough to make a cross . she took it , went slowli on down the other bank . there was no sign of human intrus . steepli on either side rose a hill , strewn with huge bowlder , mani of them larg as larg hous . the sun filter through the foliag to make a bright pattern upon the carpet of last year 's leav . the bird twitter and chirp ; the creek hum it drowsi , sooth melodi . she was wretch weari , and oh , so hungri ! a littl further , and two of the great bowlder , tumbl down from the steep , had cut off part of the creek , had form a pool which their seam and pit and fern-adorn wall hid from all observ except that of the bird and the squirrel in the bough . at onc she thought how refresh she would be if she could bath in those cool water . she look round , step in between the bowlder . she peer out ; she listen . she was safe ; she drew back into her littl inclosur . there was a small dri shelf of rock . she hurri off her cloth , stood a moment in the delici warmth of the sunshin , step into the pool . she would have like to splash about ; but she dare make no sound that could be heard abov the nois of the water . luckili the creek was just there rather loud , as it was express it extrem annoy over the stolid impud of the interrupt bowlder . while she was wait for the sun to dri her she look at her undercloth . she simpli could not put them on as they were . she knelt at the edg of the shelf and rins them out as well as she could . then she spread them on the thick tuft of overhang fern where the hot sun would get full swing at them . the brown stock of the two mismat she had brought along almost match the pair she was wear . as there was a hole in the toe of one of them , she discard it , and so had one fresh stock . she dri her feet thorough with the stock she was discard . then she put her corset and her dress direct upon her bodi . she could not afford to wait until the undercloth dri ; she would carri them until she found for herself a more remot and better hide place where she could await nightfal . she stuf the stock with the hole deep into a cleft in the rock and laid a small stone upon it so that it was conceal . here where there were no trace , no remind of the human race which had cast her out and pursu her with tortur of bodi and soul , here in the wilder her spirit were go up , and her young eye were look hope round and forward . the up-pil horror of those two day and their hideous climax seem a dream which the sun had scatter . hope ! that bless inexperi and sheer imagin of youth enabl it to hope in a larg , vagu way when to hope for ani definit and real thing would be imposs . she clean her tan low shoe with branch of fern and grass , put them on . it is imposs to account for the peculiar of physic vaniti . probabl no one was ever born who had not physic vaniti of some kind ; susan 's was her feet and ankl . not her eye , nor her hair , nor her contour , nor her skin , nor her figur , though ani or all of these might well have been her pleasur . of them she never thought in the way of pride or vaniti . but of her feet and ankl she was both proud and vain -- in a reserv , wholli unobtrus way , be it said , so quiet that she had pass unsuspect . there was reason for this shi , secret self-satisfact , so amus in one otherwis self-unconsci . her feet were beauti form and the curv of her instep and ankl were beauti . she gave more attent now to the look of her shoe and of her stock than to all the rest of this difficult woodland toilet . she then put on the sailor hat , fasten the collar to her garter , slip the handkerchief into the leg of her stock . carri her undercloth , readi to roll them into a ball should she meet anyon , she resum her journey into that rocki wilder . she was sore , she had pain that were the memori of the worst horror of her hideous dream , but up in her strong , healthi bodi , up through her strong young soul , surg joy of freedom and joy of hope . compar with what her lot had been until such a few brief day befor , this lot of friendless wander in the wilder was dark inde . but she was compar it with the monstrous dream from which it was the awaken . she was almost happi -- and mad hungri . an enorm bowlder , high abov her and firm fix in the spine of the hill , invit as a place where she could see without be seen , could hide secur until dark came again . she climb to the base of it , found that she might reach the top by step from ledg to ledg with the aid of the tree grow so close around it that some of their bough seem root in it weather-d cliff . she drag herself upward the fifti or sixti feet , glad of the difficulti becaus they would make ani pursuer feel certain she had not gone that way . after perhap an hour she came upon a flat surfac where soil had form , where grass and wild flower and sever littl tree gave shade and a place to sleep . and from her eyri she command a vast sweep of countri -- hill and valley , field , creek , here and there lone farmhous , and far away to the east the glint of the river ! to the river ! that was her destin . and somehow it would be kind , would take her where she would never , never dream those fright dream again ! she went to the side of the bowlder opposit that which she had climb . she drew back hastili , readi to cri with vexat . it was not near so high or so steep ; and on the slope of the hill a short distanc away was set a littl farmhous , with smoke curl up from it rough stone chimney . she drop to all four in the tall grass and move cautious toward the edg . flat upon her breast , she work her way to the edg and look down . a faint line path led from the hous through a gate in a zigzag fenc and up to the base of her fortress . the rock had so crumbl on that side that a sort of path extend clear up to the top . but her alarm quiet somewhat when she note how the path was grass-grown . as near as she could judg it was about five o'clock . so that smoke meant breakfast ! her eye fix hungrili upon the thin column of violet vapor mount straight into the still morn air . when smoke rose in that fashion , she rememb , it was sure sign of clear weather . and then the thought came , `` what if it had been rain ! '' she simpli could not have got away . as she interest watch the littl hous and it yard she saw hurri through the burdock and dog fennel toward the base of her rock a determin look hen . susan laugh silent , it was so obvious that the hen was on a press and secret busi errand . but almost immedi her attent was distract to observ the movement of a human be she could obscur make out through one of the window just back of the chimney . soon she saw that it was a woman , clean up a kitchen after breakfast -- the earli breakfast of the farmhous in summer . what had they had for breakfast ? she snif the air . `` i think i can smell ham and cornbread , '' she said aloud , and laugh , part at the absurd of her fanci , chiefli at the idea of such attract food . she aggrav her hunger by let her imagin loos upon the glorious possibl . a stealthi flutter brought her glanc back to the point where the hen had disappear . the hen reappear , hasten down the path and through the weed , and rejoin the flock in the yard with an air which seem to say , `` no , inde , i ve been right here all the time . '' `` now , what was she up to ? '' wonder susan , and the answer came to her . egg ! a nest hidden somewher near or in the base of the rock ! could she get down to that nest without be seen from the hous or from ani other part of the region below ? she drew back from the edg , crawl through the grass to the place where the path , if path it could be call , reach the top . she was delight to find that it made the ascent through a wide cleft and not along the outsid . she let herself down cautious as the footway was crumbl and rotten and slipperi with grass . at the lower end of the cleft she peer out . tree and bush -- plenti of them , a thick shield between her and the valley . she move slowli downward ; a misstep might send her through the bough to the hillsid forti feet below . she had gone up and down sever time befor her hunger-sharpen eye caught the gleam of white through the fern grow thick out of the moist mossi crack which everywher seam the wall . she push the fern asid . there was the nest , the length of her forearm into the dim seclus of a deep hole . she felt round , found the egg that was warm . and as she drew it out she laugh soft and said half aloud : `` breakfast is readi ! '' no , not quit readi . hook one arm round the bough of a tree that shot up from the hillsid to the height of the rock and beyond , she press her foot firm against the protect root of an ancient vine of poison ivi . thus ensconc , she had free hand ; and she proceed to remov the thin shell of the egg piec by piec . she had difficulti in restrain herself until the end . at last she put the whole egg into her mouth . and never had she tast anyth so good . but one egg was onli an appet . she reach in again . she did not wish to despoil the meritori hen unnecessarili , so she held the egg up in her inclos finger and look through it , as she had often seen the cook do at home . she was not sure , but the insid seem muddi . she laid it to one side , tri anoth . it was clear and she ate it as she had eaten the first . she laid asid the third , the fourth , and the fifth . the sixth seem all right -- but was not . fortun she had not been certain enough to feel justifi in put the whole egg into her mouth befor tast it . the tast , howev , was enough to make her reflect that perhap on the whole two egg were suffici for breakfast , especi as there would be at least dinner and supper befor she could go further . as she did not wish to risk anoth descent , she continu to sort out the egg . she found four that were , or seem to be , all right . the thirteen that look doubt or wors when test by the light she restor with the greatest care . it was an interest illustr of the rare qualiti of consider which at that period of her life domin her charact . she put the four egg in the bosom of her blous and climb up to her eyri . all at onc she felt the delici languor of bodi and mind which is natur 's forewarn that she is about to put us to sleep , whether we will or no . she lost all anxieti about safeti , look hastili around for a bed . she found just the place in a corner of the littl tableland where the grass grew tall and thick . she took from her bosom the four egg -- her dinner and supper -- and put them between the root of a tree with a cover of broad leav over them to keep them cool . she pull grass to make a pillow , took off her collar and laid herself down to sleep . and that day 's sun did not shine upon a prettier sight than this sound and sweet sleep girl , with her oval face suffus by a gentl flush , with her round young shoulder just move the bosom of her gray silk blous , with her slim , grace leg curl up to the edg of her care smooth blue serg skirt . you would have said never a care , much less a sorrow , had shadow her dawn life . and that is what it mean to be young -- and free from the curs of self-piti , and ignor of life 's saddest truth , that futur and past are not two contrast ; one is sure bright and the other is sober , but they are part of a continu fabric woven of the same thread and into the same pattern from begin to end . when she awok , beauti rest , her eye clear and soft , the shadow which had been long toward the southwest were long , though not so long , toward the southeast . she sat up and smile ; it was so fine to be free ! and her woe had not in the least shaken that seren optim which is youth 's most delight if most danger possess . she crawl through the grass to the edg of the rock and look out through the screen leav of the dens undergrowth . there was no smoke from the chimney of the hous . the woman , in a blue calico , was sit on the back doorstep knit . farther away , in field here and there , a few men -- not a dozen in all -- were at work . from a barnyard at the far edg of the western horizon came the faint sound of a steam thresher , and she thought she could see the men at work around it , but this might have been illus . it was a seren and love panorama of summer and countri . last of all her eye sought the glimps of distant river . she ate two of her four egg , put on the undercloth which were now thorough sun-dri , shook out and rebraid her hair . then she cast about for some way to pass the time . she explor the whole top of the rock , but that did not use up more than fifteen minut , as it was so small that everi part was visibl from everi other part . howev , she found a great mani wild flower and gather a huge bouquet of the audaci color of natur 's garden , so common yet so effect . she did a littl botan -- anyth to occupi her mind and keep it from the ugli vision and fear . but all too soon she had exhaust the resourc of her hide place . she look down into the valley to the north -- the valley through which she had come . she might go down there and roam ; it would be someth to do , and her young impati of restraint was make her so restless that she felt she could not endur the confin of that littl rock . it had seem huge ; a brief experi of freedom , a few hour between her and the night 's horror and terror , and it had shrunk to a tini prison cell . sure she would run no risk in journey through that trackless wilder ; she need not be idl , she could hasten her destini by follow the creek in it lone wander , which must sooner or later bring it to the river . the river ! she was about to get the two remain egg and abandon her stronghold when it occur to her that she would do well to take a last look all around . she went back to the side of the rock face the hous . the woman had suspend knit and was gaze intent across the hollow to the west , where the road from the north enter the landscap . susan turn her eye in that direct . two horsemen at a gallop were move southward . the girl was well screen , but instinct she drew still further back behind the bush -- but not so far that the two on horseback , ride so eager , were out of her view . the road dip into the hollow . the gallop horsemen disappear with it . susan shift her gaze to the point on the brow of the hill where the road reappear . she was quiver in everi nerv . when they came into view again she would know . the place she was watch swam befor her eye . sudden the two , still at a gallop , rose upon the crest of the hill . jeb and her uncl zeke ! her vision clear , her nerv steadi . they did not draw rein until they were at the road gate of the littl hous . the woman rose , put down her knit in the seat of her stiff , rush-bottom rocker , advanc to the fenc . the air was still , but susan could not hear a sound , though she crane forward and strain her ear to the uttermost . she shrank as if she had been struck when the three began to gaze up at the rock -- to gaze , it seem to her , at the veri spot where she was stand . was her screen less thick than she thought ? had they seen -- if not her , perhap part of her dress ? wild her heart beat as jeb dismount from his hors the mare behind which she had made her wed journey -- and stood in the gateway , talk with the woman and look toward the top of the rock . zeke warham turn his hors and began to ride slowli away . he got as far as the brow of the hill , with jeb still in the gateway , hesit . then susan heard : '' hold on , mr. warham . i reckon you re right . '' warham halt his hors , jeb remount and join him . as the woman return toward the back doorstep , the two men rode at a walk down into the hollow . when they reappear it was on the road by which they had come . and the girl knew the pursuit in that direct -- the right direct -- was over . trembl and with a flutter in her breast like the flap of a bird wing , she sank to the ground . present she burst into a passion of tear . without know whi , she tore off the wed ring which until then she had forgotten , and flung it out among the treetop . a few minut , and she dri her eye and stood up . the two horsemen were leav the landscap at the point at which they had enter it . the girl would not have known , would have been frighten by , her own face had she seen it as she watch them go out of her sight -- out of her life . she did not understand herself , for she was at that age when one is no more conscious of the forc lock up within his unexplor and untest charact than the dynamit cartridg is of it secret of power and terror . chapter xi she felt free to go now . she walk toward the place where she had left the egg . it was on the side of the rock overlook the creek . as she knelt to remov the leav , she heard from far below a man 's voic sing . she lean forward and glanc down at the creek . in a moment appear a young man with a fish rod and a bag slung over his shoulder . his gray and white stripe flannel trouser were roll to his knee . his fair skin and the fair hair wave about his forehead were expos by the flapping-brim straw hat set upon the back of his head . his voic , a strong and man tenor , was send up those steep a song she had never heard befor -- a song in italian . she had not seen what he look like when she rememb herself and hastili fell back from view . she drop to the grass and crawl out toward the ledg . when she show her face it so happen that he was look straight at her . `` hello ! '' he shout . `` that you , nell ? '' susan drew back , her blood in a tumult . from below , after a brief silenc , came a burst of laughter . she wait a long time , then through a shield of bunch of grass look again . the young man was gone . she wish that he had resum his song , for she thought she had never heard one so beauti . becaus she did not feel safe in descend until he was well out of the way , and becaus she was so comfort lie there in the afternoon sunshin watch the bird and listen to them , she continu on there , glanc now and then at where the creek enter and where it left her rang of vision , to make sure that no one els should come and catch her . sudden sound a voic from somewher behind her : '' hey , nell ! i 'm come ! '' she sprang to her feet , face about ; and cruso was not more agit when he saw the print of the nake foot on his island strand . the straw hat with the flap brim was just lift abov the edg of the rock at the opposit side , where the path was . she could not escap ; the shelf offer no hide place . now the young man was step to the level , pant loud . `` gee , what a climb for a hot day ! '' he cri . `` where are you ? '' with that he was look at susan , less than twenti yard away and drawn up defiant . he stare , took off his hat . he had close-crop wavi hair and eye as gray as susan 's own , but it was a blue-gray instead of violet . his skin was fair , too , and his express intellig and sympathet . in spite of his hat , and his blue cotton shirt , and trouser roll high on bare sunburn leg , there was noth of the yokel about him . `` i beg your pardon , '' he exclaim half humor . `` i thought it was my cousin nell . '' `` no , '' said susan , disarm by his courtesi and by the frank engag manner of it . `` i did n't mean to intrud . '' he show white teeth in a broad smile . `` i see from your face that this is your privat domain .

'' she sprang up and listen , with eye soft shine and head a littl on one side . the song end ; her heart beat fast . it was not mani minut befor she , watch at the end of the path , saw him appear at the bottom of the huge cleft . and the look in his eye , the merri smile about his express mouth , delight her . `` i 'm so glad to see you !

'' said he . `` i 'm hungri as the horseleech 's daughter . and you -- whi , you must be starv . i 'm afraid i did n't bring what you like . but i did the best i could . i raid the pantri , took everyth that was portabl .

'' and he set her an exampl she was not slow to follow . the sun had slip down behind the hill of the northwest horizon . the bird were tune for their even song . a breez sprang up and coquet with the stray of her wavi dark hair . and they sat cross-leg on the grass on opposit side of the tablecloth and joke and laugh and ate , and ate and laugh and joke until the star began to appear in the vast pale opal of the sky . they had chosen the center of the grassi platform for their banquet ; thus , from where they sat onli the top of tree and the sky were to be seen . and after they had finish she lean on her elbow and listen while he , smoke his cigarett , told her of his life as a newspap man in cincinnati . the twilight fade into dusk , the dusk into a scarlet dark . `` when the moon come up we ll start , '' said he . `` you can ride behind me on the hors part of the way , anyhow . '' the shadow of the part , the end of this happi , fell upon her . how lone it would be when he was gone ! `` i haven't told you my name , '' she said . `` i ve told you mine roderick spenser -- with an _s_ , not a _c_ .

'' his manner was convinc enough , but she did not give in until moonris came without her have thought of ani other plan . he was to be bob peter , she his sister kate , and they were to hail from a farm in the kentucki hill back of milton . they practic the dialect of the region and found that they could talk it well enough to pass the test of a few sentenc they pack the fish bag ; she wrap the two egg in paper and put them in the empti milk bottl . they descend by the path -- a slow journey in the dark of that side of the rock , as there were mani danger , includ the danger of make a nois that might be heard by some restless person at the hous . after half an hour they were safe at the base of the rock ; they skirt it , went down to the creek , found the hors tie where he had left it . with her seat sideway behind him and hold on by an arm half round his waist , they made a merri but not veri speedi advanc toward the river , keep as near due south as the break in the hill permit . after a while he ask : `` do you ever think of the stage ? '' `` i ve never seen a real stage play , '' said she . `` but i want to -- and i will , the first chanc i get . '' `` i meant , did you ever think of go on the stage ? '' `` no . '' so dare a flight would have been imposs for a babi imagin in the cage of the respectable-family-in-a-small-town . `` it 's one of my dream to write play , '' he went on . `` would n't it be queer if some day i wrote play for you to act in ? '' when one 's fanci is as free as was susan 's then , it take ani direct chanc may suggest . susan 's fanci instant wing along this fascin rout . `` i ve given recit at school , and in the play we use to have they let me take the best part -- that is -- until -- until a year or so ago .

'' `` i know how you feel , '' repli he , all unawar of the real reason for this deep humil . `` when i first struck town i felt that way . it seem to me i could n't hope ever to line up with the clever peopl they had there . but i soon saw there was noth in that idea . the fact is , everywher in the world there 's a lot more thing to do than peopl who can do them . most of those who get to the top -- where did they start ? where we re start . '' she was immens flatter by that `` we '' and grate for it . but she held to her origin opinion . `` there would n't be a chanc for me , '' said she . `` they would n't have me . '' `` oh , i understand , '' said he and he fanci he did . he laugh gayli at the idea that in the theater anyon would care who she was -- what kind of past she had had -- or present either , for that matter . said he , `` you need n't worri . on the stage they do n't ask ani question -- ani question except can you act ? can you get it over ? can you get the hand ? ' '' then this stage , it was the world she had dream of -- the world where there live a wholli new kind of peopl -- peopl who could make room for her . she thrill , and her heart beat wild . in a strang quiet , intens voic , she said : '' i want to tri . i 'm sure i ll get along there . i ll work -- oh , so hard . i ll do _anyth ! _ '' '' that 's the talk , '' cri he . `` you ve got the stuff in you . '' she said littl the rest of the journey . her mind was busi with the idea he had by merest accid given her . if he could have look in upon her thought , he would have been amaz and not a littl alarm by the ferment he had set up . where they reach the river the bank was mud and thick willow , the haunt of incred armi of mosquito . `` it 's a mysteri to me , '' cri he , `` whi these fiend live in lone place far away from blood , when they re so mad about it . '' after some search he found a clear stretch of sandi gravel where she would be not too uncomfort while he was gone for a boat . he left the hors with her and walk upstream in the direct of brooksburg . as he had warn her that he might be gone a long time , he knew she would not be alarm for him -- and she had alreadi prove that timid about herself was not in her natur . but he was alarm for her -- this girl alon in that lone dark -- with light enough to make her visibl to ani prowler . about an hour after he left her he return in a rowboat he had borrow at the water mill . he hitch the hors in the deep shadow of the break in the bank . she got into the boat , put on the slip and the sunbonnet , put her sailor hat in the bag . they push off and he began the long hard row across and upstream . the moon was high now and was still near enough to it full glori to pour a flood of beauti light upon the broad river -- the love ohio at it loveliest part . `` wo n't you sing ? '' he ask . and without hesit she began one of the simpl familiar love song that were all the music to which the sutherland girl had access . she sang soft , in a deep sweet voic , sweeter even than her speak voic . she had the sunbonnet in her lap ; the moon shone full upon her face . and it seem to him that he was in a dream ; there was nowher a suggest of realiti -- not of it prose , not even of it poetri . onli in the land no wake eye has seen could such a thing be . the low sweet voic sang of love , the oar click rhythmic in the lock and clove the water with music splash ; the river , between it steep hill , shone in the moonlight , with a breez like a friend spirit move upon it surfac . he urg her , and she sang anoth song , and anoth . she sigh when she saw the red lantern on the carrollton wharf ; and he , turn his head and see , echo her sigh . `` the first chanc , you must sing me that song , '' she said . `` from rigoletto ' ? i will . but -- it tell how fickl women are -- like a feather in the wind. ' . . . they are n't all like that , though -- do n't you think so ? '' `` sometim i think everybodi 's like a feather in the wind , '' repli she . `` about love -- and everyth . '' he laugh . `` except those peopl who are where there is n't ani wind . '' chapter xii for some time spenser had been row well in toward the kentucki shore , to avoid the swift current of the kentucki river which rush into the ohio at carrollton . a few yard below it mouth , in the quiet stretch of backwat along shore , lay the wharf-boat , littl more than a land stage . the hotel was but a hundr feet away , at the top of the steep leve . it was midnight , so everyon in the villag had long been asleep . after sever minut of thunder hammer roderick succeed in draw to the door a barefoot man with a candl in his huge , knot hand -- a man of great statur , amaz lean and long of leg , with a monstrous head thatch and front with coars , yellow-brown hair . he had on a dirti cotton shirt and dirti cotton trouser -- a night dress that serv equal well for the day . his feet were flat and thick and were hideous with corn and bunion . susan had earli been made a critic observ of feet by the unusu symmetri of her own . she had seen few feet that were fit to be seen ; but never , she thought , had she seen an exhibit so repel . `` what t'hell -- -- '' he began . then , discov susan , he growl , '' beg pardon , miss . '' roderick explain -- that is , told the prearrang stori . the man point to a grimi regist on the offic desk , and roderick set down the fish bag and wrote in a cramp , scrawli hand , `` kate peter , milton , ky. '' the man look at it through his screen of hair and beard , said , '' come on , ma'am . '' `` just a minut , '' said roderick , and he drew `` kate '' asid and said to her in a low tone : `` i ll be back sometim tomorrow , and then we ll start at onc . but -- to provid against everyth -- do n't be alarm if i do n't come . you ll know i could n't help it . and wait . '' susan nod , look at him with trust , grate eye . `` and , '' he went on hurri , `` i ll leav this with you , to take care of . it 's your as much as mine . '' she saw that it was a pocketbook , instinct put her hand behind her . `` do n't be silli , '' he said , with good-humor impati . `` you'll probabl not need it . if you do , you ll need it bad . and you'll pay me back when you get your place . '' he caught one of her hand and put the pocketbook in it . as his argument was unanswer , she did not resist further . she utter not a word of thank , but simpli look at him , her eye swim and about her mouth a quiver that meant a great deal in her . impuls and with flame cheek he kiss her on the cheek . `` so long , sis , '' he said loud , and strode into the night . susan did not flush ; she pale . she gaze after him with some such express as a man lost in a cave might have as he watch the flicker out of his onli light . `` this way , ma'am , '' said the hotel man sour , take up the fish bag . she start , follow him up the noisi stair to a plain , neat countri bedroom . `` the price of this here 's one fifti a day , '' said he . `` we ve got em as low as a dollar .

'' `` oh , you could n't be impolit , '' said mabel . `` you ve got that to learn , too -- and mighti import it is . we all smoke . whi not ? we got out of cigarett , but bob bought a stock this afternoon . '' susan turn to the peephol . pat , readi to take ticket , was '' bark '' vigor in the direct of shore , address a crowd which susan of cours could not see . whenev he paus for breath , burlingham lean from the box and took it up , pour out a stream of eulog of his show in that easi , light cynic voic of his . and the audienc straggl in -- young fellow and their girl , rough from along the river front , farmer in town for a day 's sport . susan did not see a singl familiar face , and she had suppos she knew , by sight at least , everyon in sutherland . from fear lest she should see someon she knew , her mind chang to long . at last she was reward . down the aisl swagger redney king , son of the washerwoman , a big hulk bulli who use to teas her by pull her hair dure recess and by kick at her shin when they happen to be next each other in the class stand in long line against the wall of the schoolroom for recit . from her secur she smile at redney as repres of all she love in the old town . and now the four member of the compani on the stage and in the dressing-room lost their eas and contemptu indiffer . they had been talk sneer about `` yokel '' and `` jay '' and '' slum bum . '' they drop all that , as there spread over them the mysteri spell of the crowd . as individu the provinci in those seat were ridicul ; as a mass they were an audienc , an object of fear and awe . mabel was almost in tear ; violet talk rapid , with excit gestur and nervous adjust of various part of her toilet . the two men pace about , eshwel trembl , tempest with sheer fright in his roll eye . they wet their dri lip with dri tongu . each again and again ask the other anxious how he was look and pace away without wait for the answer . the suspens and nervous terror took hold of susan ; she stood in the corner of the dressing-room , press herself close against the wall , her finger tight interlock and hot and cold tremor chase up and down her bodi . burlingham left the box and combin pat 's duti with his own -- a small matter , as the audienc was seat and a guard at the door was necessari onli to keep the loafer on shore from rush in free . pat advanc to the littl space reserv befor the stage , sat down and fell to tune his violin with all the nois he could make , to creat the illus of a full orchestra . miss anstruth appear in one of the forward side door of the auditorium , veri dignifi in her black satin ( paper muslin ) dress , with mani and sparkl hair and neck ornament and ring that seem alight . she bow to the audienc , pull a littl old cottag organ from under the stage and seat herself at it . after the overtur , a paus . susan , peep through a hole in the drop , saw the curtain go up , drew a long breath of terror as the audienc was reveal beyond the row of footlight , beyond the big , befrizzl blond head of violet and the drink-sear face of pat . from the rear of the auditorium came burlingham smooth-flow , faint amus voic , announc the begin of the perform `` a delight feast throughout , ladi and gentlemen , amus yet elev , ever moral yet with none of the depress sad of puritan . for , ladi and gentlemen , while we are pious , we are not puritan . the first number is a monologu , the mad princ , ' by that emin artist , gregori tempest . he has deliv it befor vast audienc amid thunder of applaus . '' susan thrill as tempest strode forth -- tempest transform by the footlight and by her young imagin into a true king most wonder and romant bereft of reason by the woe that had assail him in horrid phalanx . if anyon had point out to her that tempest 's aw voic was simpli cheap rant , or that her own woe had been as terribl as ani that had ever visit a king , or that when peopl go mad it is never from grief but from insid unromant addl by foolish eat and drink -- if anyon had attempt then and there to educ the girl , how angri it would have made her , how she would have hate that well-mean person for spoil her illus ! the spell of the stage seiz her with tempest 's first line , first eleg despair gestur . it held her through burlingham and anstruth 's `` sketch '' of a matrimoni quarrel , through connemora and eshwel 's `` delici symphon romantic '' of a lover ' quarrel and make up , through tempest 's recit of '' lasca , '' die to shield her cowboy lover from the hoof of the stamped herd . how the tear did stream from susan 's eye , as tempest wail out those last line : but i wonder whi i do not care for the thing that are like the thing that were ? can it be that half my heart lie buri there , in texa down by the rio grand ? she saw the littl grave in the desert and the vast blue sky and the buzzard sail lazili to and fro , and it seem to her that tempest himself had inspir such a love , had lost a sweetheart in just that way . no wonder he look gaunt and hollow-ey and sallow . the last part of the perform was holi land and comic pictur thrown from the rear on a sheet substitut for the drop . as burlingham had to work the magic lantern from the dressing-room ( while tempest , in a kind of monk 's robe , use his voic and elocutionari power in describ the pictur , now lugubri and now in `` lighter vein '' ) , susan was forc to retreat to the forward deck and miss that part of the show . but she watch burlingham shift the slide and alter the form of the lens , and was in anoth way as much thrill and spellbound as by the act . nor did the spell vanish when , with the audienc gone , they all sat down to a late supper , and made coars jest and mock at their own do and at the peopl who had applaud . susan did not hear . she felt proud that she was permit in so distinguish a compani . everi disagre impress vanish . how could she have thought these genius common and cheap ! how had she dare appli to them the standard of the peopl , the dull , commonplac peopl , among whom she had been brought up ! if she could onli qualifi for membership in this galaxi ! the thought made her feel like a worm aspir to be a star . tempest , whom she had like least , now fill her with admir . she saw the tragedi of his life plain and sad upon his featur . she could not look at him without her heart contract in an ach . it was not long befor mr. tempest , who believ himself a lady-kil , note the ingenu look in the young girl 's face , and began to pose . and it was hard three bite of a ham sandwich thereaft when mabel connemora note tempest shoot of his cuff and rumpl of his oili ringlet and roll of his hollow eye . and at the sight miss mabel bright eye becam bad and her tongu shot satir at him . but susan did not observ this . after supper they went straightway to bed . burlingham drew the curtain round the berth let down for susan . the other indulg in no such pruderi on so hot a night . they put out the lamp and got readi for bed and into it by the dim light trickl in through the big rear doorway and the two small side doorway forward . to help on the circul of air pat rais the stage curtain and drop , and open the littl door forward . each sleeper had a small net suspend over him from the ceil ; without that net the dens swarm of savag mosquito would have made sleep imposs . as it was , the loud sing of these baffl thousand kept susan awak . after a while , to calm her brain , excit by the even throng impress and by the new -- or , rather , review -- ambit born of them , susan rose and went soft out on deck , in her nightgown of calico slip . becaus of the breez the mosquito did not troubl her there , and she stood a long time watch the town 's few faint light -- watch the star , the throng star of the milki way -- dream -- dream -- dream . yesterday had almost fade from her , for youth live onli in tomorrow -- youth in tomorrow , age in yesterday , and none of us in today which is all we realli have . and she , with her wonder health of bodi mean youth as long as it last , she would certain be young until she was veri old -- would keep her youth -- her dream -- her live alway in tomorrow . she was dream of her first real tomorrow , now . she would work hard at this wonder profess -- _her_ profess ! -- would be humbl and attent ; and sure the day must come when she too would feel upon her heart the intox beat of those magic wave of applaus ! susan , more excit than ever , slip soft into the cabin and stole into her curtain berth . like the sough of the storm abov the whimper of the tortur leav the stentorian snore of two of the sleeper resound abov the nois of the mosquito . she had hard extend herself in her close littl bed when she heard a stealthi step , saw one of her curtain drawn asid . `` who is it ? '' she whisper , unsuspici , for she could see onli a vagu form darken the space between the part curtain . the answer came in a hoars underton : `` ye dainti littl darl ! '' she sat up , struck out mad , scream at the top of her lung . the curtain fell back into place , the snore stop . susan , all in a sweat and a shiver , lay quiet . hoars whisper ; then in burlingham 's voic stern and gruff -- '' get back to your bed and let her alon , you rolling-ey -- -- '' the sentenc end with as foul a spatter of filth as man can fling at man . silenc again , and after a few minut the two snore resum their bass accompani to the falsetto of the mosquito chorus . susan got a littl troubl sleep , was wide awak when violet came say , `` if you want to bath , i ll bring you a bucket of water and you can put up your berth and do it behind your curtain .

'' and she agre with him , as she thought how smooth and agreeabl they were drift into the unknown , full of the most fascin possibl . how attract this life was , how much at home she felt among these peopl , and if anyon should tell him about her birth or about how she had been degrad by ferguson , it would n't in the least affect their feel toward her , she was sure . `` when do -- do you -- tri me ? '' she ask . `` tomorrow night , at bethlehem -- a bum littl town for us . we'll stay there a coupl of day . i want you to get use to appear . '' he nod at her encourag . `` you ve got stuff in you , real stuff . do n't you doubt it . get self-confid -- conceit , if you pleas . nobodi arriv anywher without it . you want to feel that you can do what you want to do . a fool 's conceit is that he 's it alreadi . a sensibl man 's conceit is that he can be it , if he ll onli work hard and in the right way . see ? '' `` i -- i think i do , '' said the girl . `` i 'm not sure . '' burlingham smoke his cigar in silenc . when he spoke , it was with eye care avert . `` there 's anoth subject the spirit move me to talk to you about . that 's the one miss connemora open up with you yesterday . '' as susan move uneasili , `` now , do n't get scare . i 'm not let the woman busi bother me much nowaday . all i think of is how to get on my feet again . i want to have a theater on broadway befor the old black-flagg overtak my craft and make me walk the plank and jump out into the big guess . so you need n't think i 'm go to worri you . i 'm not . '' `` oh , i did n't think -- -- '' '' you ought to have , though , '' interrupt he . `` a man like me is a rare except . i 'm a rare except to my ordinari self , to be quit honest . it ll be best for you alway to assum that everi man you run across is look for just one thing . you know what ? '' susan , the flush gone from her cheek , nod . `` i suppos connemora has put you wise . but there are some thing even she do n't know about that subject . now , i want you to listen to your grandfath . rememb what he say . and think it over until you understand it . '' `` i will , '' said susan . `` in the life you ve come out of , virtu in a woman 's everyth . she 's got to be virtuous , or at least to have the reput of it -- or she 's noth . you understand that ? '' `` yes , '' said susan . `` i understand that -- now . '' `` veri well . now in the life you re go into , virtu in a woman is noth -- no more than it is in a man anywher . the woman who make a career becom like the man who make a career . how is it with a man ? some are virtuous , other are not . but no man let virtu bother him and nobodi bother about his virtu . that 's the way it is with a woman who cut loos from the convent life of societi and home and all that . she is virtuous or not , as she happen to inclin . her real interest in herself , her real valu , lie in anoth direct . if it doe n't , if she continu to be agit about her virtu as if it were all there is to her -- then the sooner she hike back to respect , to the convent routin , whi the better for her . she ll never make a career , ani more than she could drive an automobil through a crowd street and at the same time keep a big pictur hat on straight . do you follow me ? '' `` i 'm not sure , '' said the girl . `` i ll have to think about it . '' `` that 's right . do n't misunderstand . i 'm not talk for or against virtu . i 'm simpli talk practic life , and all i mean is that you wo n't get on there by your virtu , and you wo n't get on by your lack of virtu . now for my advic . '' susan 's look of unconsci admir and attent was the subtlest flatteri . it frank , ingenu show of her implicit trust in him so impress him with his respons that he hesit befor he said : '' never forget this , and do n't stop think about it until you understand it : make men _as_ men incident in your life , precis as men who amount to anyth make women _as_ women incident . '' her first sensat was obvious disappoint . she had expect someth far more impress . said she : '' i do n't care anyth about men . '' `` be sensibl ! how are you to know now what you care about and what you do n't ? '' was burlingham 's laugh rebuk . `` and in the line you ve taken -- the stage -- with your emot alway be stir up , with your thought alway hover round the relat of men and women -- for that 's the onli subject of play and music , and with opportun thrust at you as it never thrust at convent peopl you ll probabl soon find you care a great deal about men . but do n't ever let your emot hinder or hurt or destroy you . use them to help you . i guess i'm shoot pretti far over that young head of your , ai n't i ? '' `` not so veri far , '' said the girl . `` anyhow , i ll rememb . '' `` if you live big enough and long enough , you ll go through three stage . the first is the one you re in now . they ve alway taught you without realiz it , and so you think that onli the strong can afford to do right . you think do right make the ordinari person , like yourself , easi prey for those who do wrong . you think that good peopl -- if they re realli good -- have to wait until they get to heaven befor they get a chanc . '' `` is n't that so ? '' `` no . but you ll not realiz it until you pass into the second stage . there , you ll think you see that onli the strong can afford to do wrong . you ll think that everyon , except the strong , get it in the neck if he or she doe anyth out of the way . you ll think you re be punish for your sin , and that , if you had behav yourself , you 'd have got on much better . that 's the stage that 's come ; and what you go through with there -- how you come out of the fight -- will decid your fate -- show whether or not you ve got the real stuff in you . do you understand ? '' susan shook her head . `` i thought not . you have n't live long enough yet . well , i'll finish , anyhow . '' `` i ll rememb , '' said susan . `` i ll think about it until i do understand . '' `` i hope so . the weather and the sceneri make me feel like philosoph . final , if you come through the second stage all right , you ll enter the third stage . there , you ll see that you were right at first when you thought onli the strong could afford to do right . and you ll see that you were right in the second stage when you thought onli the strong could afford to do wrong . for you ll have learn that onli the strong can afford to act at all , and that they can do right or wrong as they pleas _becaus they are strong_ . '' `` then you do n't believ in right , at all ! '' exclaim the girl , much depress , but whether for the right or for her friend she could not have told . `` now , who said that ? '' demand he , amus . `` what _did_ i say ? whi -- if you want to do right , be strong or you ll be crush ; and if you want to do wrong , take care again to be strong -- or you ll be crush . my moral is , be strong ! in this world the good weakl and the bad weakl had better lie low , hide in the tall grass . the strong inherit the earth . '' they were silent a long time , she think , he observ her with sad tender . at last he said : '' you are a nice sweet girl -- well brought up . but that mean bad brought up for the life you ve got to lead -- the life you ve got to learn to lead . '' `` i 'm begin to see that , '' said the girl . her graviti made him feel like laugh , and brought the tear to his eye . the laughter he suppress . `` you re go to fight your way up to what 's call the triumphant class -- the peopl on top -- they have all the success , all the money , all the good time . well , the thing you ve been taught -- at church -- in the sunday school -- in the nice storybook you ve read -- those thing are all for the triumphant class , or for peopl work meek along in the station to which god has appoint them ' and hand over their earn to their better . but those nice moral thing you believ in -- they don't appli to peopl like you -- fight their way up from the meek work class to the triumphant class . you wo n't believ me now -- wo n't understand thorough . but soon you ll see . onc you ve climb up among the success peopl you can afford to indulg -- in moder -- in practic the good old moral . ani dirti work you may need done you can hire done and pretend not to know about it . but while you re climb , no golden rule and no turn of the cheek . tooth and claw then -- not sheath but nake -- not by proxi but in your own person . '' `` but you re not like that , '' said the girl . `` the more fool i , '' repeat he . she was surpris that she understood so much of what he had said -- childlik wonder at her wise old heart , made wise almost in a night -- a wed night . when burlingham laps into silenc , laugh at himself for have talk so far over the '' kiddi 's '' head , she sat puzzl out what he had said . the world seem horribl vast and forbid , and the sky , so blue and bright , seem far , far away . she sigh profound . `` i am so weak , '' she murmur . `` i am so ignor . '' burlingham nod and wink . `` yes , but you ll grow , '' said be . `` i back you to win . '' the color pour into her cheek , and she burst into tear . burlingham thought he understood ; for onc his shrewd went far astray . excus , sinc he could not know that he had use the same phrase that had close spenser 's letter to her . late in the afternoon , when the heat had abat somewhat and they were float pleasant along with the wash gentl a-flutt from line on the roof of the auditorium , burlingham put eshwel at the rudder and with pat and the violin rehears her . `` the main thing , the onli thing to worri about , '' explain he , `` is begin right . '' she was stand in the center of the stage , he on the floor of the auditorium besid the seat orchestra . `` that mean , '' he went on , `` you ve simpli got to learn to come in right . we ll practic that for a while . '' she went to the wing -- where there was bare space for her to conceal herself by squeez tight against the wall . at the signal from him she walk out . as she had the utmost confid in his kind , and as she was alway too deepli interest in what she and other were do to be uncomfort self-consci , she was not embarrass , and thought she made the cross and took her stand veri well . he nod approv . `` but , '' said he , `` there 's a differ between a stage walk and walk anywher els -- or stand . noth is natur on the stage . if it were it would look unnatur , becaus the stage itself is artifici and whatev is there must be in harmoni with it . so everyth must be done unnatur in such a way that it _seems_ natur . just as a pictur boat look natur though it 's paint on a flat surfac . now i ll illustr . '' he gave her his hand to help her jump down ; then he climb to the stage . he went to the wing and walk out . as he came he call her attent to how he pois his bodi , how he advanc so that there would be from the auditorium no unsight view of cross leg , how he arrang hand , arm , shoulder , leg , head , feet for an attitud of complet rest . he repeat his illustr again and again , susan watch and listen with open-ey wonder and admir . she had never dream that so simpl a matter could be so complex . when he got her up besid him and went through it with her , she soon becam as use to the new motion as a beginn at the piano to stretch an octav . but it was onli after more than an hour 's practic that she move him to say : '' that ll do for a begin . now , we ll sing . '' she tri `` suwane river '' first and went through it fair well , sing to him as he stood back at the rear door . he was enthusiast -- cun burlingham , who knew so well how to get the best out of everyon ! `` mighti good -- eh , pat ? yes , mighti good . you ve got someth better than a great voic , my dear . you ve got magnet . the same thing that made me engag you the minut you ask me is go to make you -- well , go a long way -- a _long_ way . now , we ll tri the last rose of summer . ' '' she sang even better . and this improv continu through the other four song of her repertoir . his confid in her was contagi ; it was so evid that he realli did believ in her . and pat , too , wag his head in a way that made her feel good about herself . then burlingham call in the other whom he had sent to the forward deck . befor them the girl went all to piec . she made her entranc bad , she sang wors . and the wors she sang , the wors she felt and the wors her next attempt was . at last , with nerv unstrung , she broke down and sob . burlingham climb up to pat her on the shoulder . `` that 's the best sign yet , '' said he . `` it show you ve got tempera . yes -- you ve got the stuff in you . '' he quiet her , interest her in the pure mechan part of what she was do . `` do n't think of who you re do it befor , or of how you re do it , but onli of get through each step and each note . if your head 's full of that , you ll have no room for fright . '' and she was readi to tri again . when she finish the last note of `` suwane river , '' there was an outburst of hearti applaus . and the sound that pleas her most was tempest 's rich rhetor `` bravo ! '' as a man she abhor him ; but she respect the artist . and in unconsci draw this distinct she gave proof of yet anoth qualiti that was to count heavili in the come day . artist he was not . but she thought him an artist . a girl or boy without the intellig that can develop into flower and fruit would have seen and felt onli tempest , the odious person . burlingham did not let her off until she was readi to drop with exhaust . and after supper , when they were float slowli on , well out of the channel where they might be run down by some pass steamer with a flint-heart captain or pilot , she had to go at it again . she went to bed earli , and she slept without a motion or a break until the odor of the cook breakfast awaken her . when she came out , her face was bright for the first time . she was smile , laugh , chat , was delight with everyth and everybodi . even the thought of roderick spenser laid up with a broken leg recur less often and less vivid . it seem to her that the leg must be about well . the imagin of healthi youth is reluct to admit idea of gloom in ani circumst . in circumst of excit and adventur , such as susan 's at that time , it flat refus to admit them . they were at anchor befor a littl town sprawl upon the field between hill and river edg . a few loafer were chew tobacco and inspect the show boat from the shadi side of a pile of lumber . pat had alreadi gone forth with the bundl of handbil ; he was not onli wake up the town , but tour the countri in hors and buggi , was agit the farmer -- for the show boat was to stay at least two night at bethlehem . `` and we ought to do pretti well , '' said burlingham . `` the wheat 's about all thresh , and there 's a kind of lull . the hayse are n't so dead tire at night . a coupl of week ago we could n't have got half a hous by pay for it . '' as the afternoon wore away and the sun disappear behind the hill to the southwest , susan 's spirit ooz . burlingham and the other -- deliber -- paid no attent to her , act as if no great , universe-stir event were impend . immedi after supper burlingham said : '' now , vi , get busi and put her into her har . make her a work of art . '' never was there a finer display of unselfish than in their eager to help her succeed , in their intens nervous anxieti lest she should not make a hit . the bad in human natur , as mabel connemora had said , is inde almost entir if not entir the result of the compuls of circumst ; the good is the natur outcrop of normal instinct , and resum control whenev circumst permit . these wander player had suffer too much not to have the keenest and gentlest sympathi . susan look on tempest as a wick man ; yet she could not but be touch by his almost hyster excit over her debut , when the near approach of the hour made it imposs for his emot tempera longer to hide it agit . everi one of them gave or loan her a talisman -- tempest , a bit of rabbit 's foot ; anstruth , a ring that had twice save her from drown ( at least , it had been on her finger each time ) ; connemora , a hunchback 's tooth on a fade velvet string ; pat , a penni which happen to be of the date of her birth year ( the presenc of the penni was regard by all as a most encourag sign ) ; eshwel loan her a miniatur silver bug he wore on his watch chain ; burlingham 's contribut was a larg buckey -- -- '' ever sinc i ve had that , i ve never been without at least the price of a meal in my pocket . '' they had got togeth for her a kind of even dress , a pale blue chiffon-lik draperi that left her love arm and shoulder bare and clung soft to the line of her figur . they did her hair up in a grace sweep from the brow and a simpl coil behind . she look like a woman , yet like a child dress as a woman , too , for there was as alway that exuber vital which made each of the hair of her head seem individu , electr . the roug gave her color , enhanc into splendor the brillianc of her violet-gray eye -- eye so intens color and so admir frame that they were note by the least observ . when anstruth had put the last touch to her toilet and parad her to the other , there was a chorus of enthusiasm . the men no less than the women view her with the profession eye . `` did n't i tell you all ? '' cri burlingham , as they look her up and down like a group of connoisseur inspect a statu . `` was n't i right ? '' `` it is the dawn , and juliet is the east , ' '' orat tempest in rich , romant tone . `` a damn shame to wast her on these yap , '' said eshwel . connemora embrac her with tear eye . `` and as sweet as you are love , you dear ! '' she cri . `` you simpli ca n't help win . '' the two women thought her greatest charm were her form and her feet and ankl . the men insist that her charm of charm was her eye . and certain , much could be said for that view . susan 's violet-gray eye , grow grayer when she was thought , grow deeper and clearer and softer shine violet when her emot were touch -- susan 's eye were undoubt unusu even in a race in which home eye are the except . when it was her turn and she emerg into the glare of the footlight , she came to a full stop and an aw wave of weak leap up through leg and bodi to blind her eye and crash upon her brain . she shook her head , lift it high like a swimmer shake off a wave . her gaze leap in terror across the black of the auditorium with it thick-strewn round white disk of human face , sought the eye of burlingham stand in full view in the center of the rear doorway -- where he had told her to look for him . she heard pat play the last of the open chord ; burlingham lift his hand like a leader baton . and natur and sweet the note , the word of the old darkey song of long for home began to float out through the still . she did not take her gaze from burlingham . she sang her best , sang to pleas him , to show him how she appreci what he had done for her . and when she finish and bow , the outburst of applaus unnerv her , sent her dizzi and almost stagger into the wing . `` splendid ! splendid ! '' cri mabel , and anstruth embrac her , and tempest and eshwel kiss her hand . they all join in push her out again for the encor -- '' blue alsatian mountain . '' she did not sing quit so steadili , but got through in good form , the tremolo of nervous in her voic ad to the wail patho of the song 's refrain : ade , ade , ade , such dream must pass away , but the blue alsatian mountain seem to watch and wait alway . the crowd clap , stamp , whistl , shout ; but burlingham defi it . `` the ladi will sing again later , '' he cri . `` the next number on the regular program is , '' etc. , etc . the crowd yell ; burlingham stood firm , and up went the curtain on eshwel and connemora 's sketch . it got no applaus . nor did ani other number on the program . the contrast between the other and the beauti of the girl , her delic sweet , her vital youth , her fresh of the earli morn flower , was inevit . the crowd could think onli of her . the qualiti of magnet asid , she had sung neither veri well nor veri bad . but had she sung bad , still her beauti would have won her the same triumph . when she came on for her second number with a cloud-lik azur chiffon flung careless over her dark hair as a scarf , spanish fashion , she receiv a stir welcom . it frighten her , so that pat had to begin four time befor her voic faint took up the tune . again burlingham 's encourag , confid gaze , flung across the gap between them like a strong rescu hand , strengthen her to her task . this time he let the crowd have two encor -- and the show was over ; for the astut manag , see how the girl had caught on , had move her second number to the end . burlingham linger in the entranc to the auditorium to feast himself on the comment of the crowd as it pass out . when he went back he had to search for the girl , found her all in a heap in a chair at the outer edg of the forward deck . she was sob piteous . `` well , for god 's sake ! '' cri he . `` is _this_ the way you take it ! '' she lift her head . `` did i do veri bad ? '' she ask . `` you swept em off their big hulk feet , '' repli he . `` when you did n't come , i thought i 'd disappoint you . '' `` i ll bet my hand there never was such a hit made in a river show boat -- and they ve graduat some of the swell of the profess . we ll play here a week to crowd hous -- matine everi day , too . and this is a two-night stand usual . i must find some more song . '' he slap his thigh . `` the veri thing ! '' he cri . `` we ll ring in some hymn . rock of age , ' say -- and jesus , lover of my soul ' -- and you can get em off in a churchi kind of costum someth like a surplic . that ll knock em stiff . and anstruth can dope out the accompani on that wheezer . what d'you think ? '' `` whatev you want , '' said the girl . `` oh , i am so glad ! '' `` i do n't see how you got through so well , '' said he . `` i did n't dare fail , '' repli susan . `` if i had , i could n't have face you . '' and by the light of the wane moon he saw the passion gratitud of her sensit young face . `` oh -- i ve done noth , '' said he , wipe the tear from his eye -- for he had his full share of the impuls , sentiment tempera of his profess . `` pure selfish . '' susan gaze at him with eye of the pure deep violet of strongest feel . `` _i_ know what you did , '' she said in a low voic . `` and -- i 'd die for you . '' burlingham had to use his handkerchief in deal with his eye now . `` this busi has given me hyster , '' said he with a queer attempt at a laugh . then , after a moment , `` god bless you , littl girl . you wait here a moment . i ll see how supper get on . '' he wish to go ahead of her , for he had a shrewd suspicion as to the state of mind of the rest of the compani . and he was right . there they sat in the litter of peanut hull , popcorn , and fruit skin which the audienc had left . on everi counten was jealous gloom . `` what 's wrong ? '' inquir burlingham in his cheer deris way . `` you are a nice bunch , you are ! '' they shift uneasili . mabel snap out , `` where 's the infant prodigi ? is she so stuck on herself alreadi that she won't associ with us ? '' `` you grown-up babi , '' mock burlingham . `` i found her out there cri in dark becaus she thought she 'd fail . now you go bring her in , conni . as for the rest of you , i 'm disgust . here we ve hit on someth that ll land us in easi street , and you re all fill up with poison . '' they were asham of themselv . burlingham had brought back to them vivid the girl 's simplic and sweet that had won their heart , even the heart of the women in whom jealousi of her young beauti would have been more than excus . anstruth began to get out the supper dish and mabel slip away toward the forward deck . `` when the child come in , '' pursu burlingham , '' i want to see you peopl look and act human . '' `` we are a lot of damn fool , '' admit eshwel . `` that 's whi we'r bum actor instead of do well at some respect busi . '' and his jealousi went the way of violet 's and mabel 's . pat began to rememb that he had share in the triumph -- where would she have been without his violin work ? but tempest remain somber . in his case better natur was have a particular hard time of it . his vaniti had got savag wound from the hoot and the `` oh , bite it off , hamfat , '' which had greet his impress lectur on the magic lantern pictur . he eye burlingham glum . he exoner the girl , but not burlingham . he was convinc that the manag , in a spirit of mean reveng , had put up a job on him . it simpli could not be in the ordinari cours that ani audienc , without some sli trickeri of prompt from an old expert of theatric `` double-cross , '' would be impati for a mere chit of an amateur when it might listen to his rich , mellow eloqu . susan came shyli -- and at the first glanc into her face her associ despis themselv for their petti . it is imposs for envi and jealousi and hatr to stand befor the light of such a natur as susan 's . away from her these veri human friend of her might hate her -- but in her presenc they could not resist the charm of her sincer . everyon 's spirit went up with the supper . it was pat who said to burlingham , `` bob , we re go to let the pullet in on the profit equal , are n't we ? '' `` sure , '' repli burlingham . `` anybodi kick ? '' the other protest enthusiast except tempest , who shot a glanc of fieri scorn at burlingham over a fork laden with potato salad . `` then -- you re elect , miss sackvill , '' said burlingham . susan 's puzzl eye demand an explan . `` just this , '' said he . `` we divid equal at the end of the trip all we ve rake in , after the rent of the boat and expens are taken off . you get your equal share exact as if you start with us . '' `` but that would n't be fair , '' protest the girl . `` i must pay what i owe you first . '' `` she mean two dollar she borrow of me at carrollton , '' explain burlingham . and they all laugh uproari . `` i ll onli take what 's fair , '' said the girl . `` i vote we give it all to her , '' roll out tempest in tragedi tone for classic satir . befor mabel could hurl at him the probabl coars retort she instant got her lip readi to make , burlingham 's cool , peace-compel tone broke in : '' miss sackvill 's right . she must get onli what 's fair . she share equal from tonight on -- less two dollar . '' susan nod delight . she did not know -- and the other did not at the excit moment recal -- that the compani was to date eleven dollar less well off than when it start from the headwat of the ohio in earli june . but burlingham knew , and that was the caus of the quiet grin to which he treat himself . chapter xv burlingham had live too long , too activ , and too intellig to have left ani of his larg , origin stock of the optim that had so often shipwreck his career in spite of his talent and his energi . out of the bitter of experi he use to say , `` a young optimist is a young fool . an old optimist is an old ass . a fool may learn , an ass ca n't . '' and again , `` an optimist steam through the fog , take it for grant everyth 's all right . a pessimist steam ahead too , but he get readi for troubl . '' howev , he was wise enough to keep his privat misgiv and reserv from his associ ; the leader of the human race alway talk optim and think pessim . he had told the compani that susan was sure to make a go ; and after she had made a go , he announc the begin of a season of triumph . but he was surpris when his predict came true and they had to turn peopl away from the next afternoon 's perform . he began to believ they realli could stay a week , and hire a man to fill the street of new washington and other inland villag and town of the counti with a handbil headlin susan . the news of the love young ballad singer in the show boat at bethlehem spread , as interest news ever doe , and down came the peopl to see and hear , and to go away exclaim . bethlehem , the sleepi , show that it could wake when there was anyth worth wake for . burlingham put on the hymn in the middl of the week , and even the clergi sent their famili . everi morn susan , either with mabel or with burlingham , or with both , took a long walk into the countri . it was burlingham , by the way , who taught her the necess of regular and method long walk for the preserv of her health . when she return there was alway a crowd loung about the land wait to gape at her and whisper . it was intox to her , this delici draught of the headi wine of fame ; and burlingham was not unprepar for the evid that she thought pretti well of herself , felt that she had arriv . he laugh to himself indulg . `` let the kiddi enjoy herself , '' thought he . `` she need the self-confid now to give her a good foundat to stand on . then when she find out what a fals alarm this jay excit was , she ll not be swept clean away into despair . '' the chief element in her happi , he of cours knew noth about . until this success -- which she , have no basi for comparison , could not but exagger -- she had been crush and abus more deepli than she had dare admit to herself by her birth which made all the world scorn her and by the seri of calam climax in that afternoon and night of horror at ferguson 's . this success -- it seem to her to give her the right to have been born , the right to live on and hold up her head without effort after ferguson . `` i ll show them all , befor i get through , '' she said to herself over and over again . `` they ll be proud of me . ruth will be boast to everyon that i 'm her cousin . and sam wright -- he ll wonder that he ever dare touch such a famous , great woman . '' she onli half believ this herself , for she had much common sens and small self-confid . but pretend that she believ it all gave her the most delici pleasur . burlingham took such frank joy in her innoc vaniti -- so far as he understood it and so far as she exhibit it -- that the other were good-humor about it too -- all the other except tempest , whom conceit and defeat had long sinc sour through and through . a tith of susan 's success would have made him unbear , for like most human be he had a vaniti that was atlantosaurian on starvat ration and would have fill the whole earth if it had been fed a few crumb . small wonder that we are ever eager on the alert for sign of vaniti in other ; we are seek the curious comfort there is in the feel that other have our own weak to a more ridicul degre . tempest twitch to jeer open at susan , whose exhibit was realli timid and modest and not mere excus but justifi . but he dare go no further than hold haughtili aloof and cast vagu into the air ever and anon a tragic sneer . susan would not have understood if she had seen , and did not see . she was tread the height , her eye upon the sky . she held grave consult with burlingham , with violet , with mabel , about improv her part . she took it all veri , veri serious -- and burlingham was glad of that . `` yes , she doe take herself serious , '' he admit to anstruth . `` but that won't do ani harm as she 's so young , and as she take her work serious , too . the troubl about take oneself serious is it stop growth . she has n't got that form of it . '' `` not yet , '' said violet . `` she ll wake from her littl dream , poor child , long befor the fatal stage . '' and he heav a sigh for his own lost illus -- those illus that had cost him so dear . burlingham had intend to make at least one stop befor jeffersonvill , the first larg town on the way down . but susan 's capac as a house-fil decid him for push straight for it . `` we ll go where there 's a big popul to be drawn on , '' said he . but he did not say that in the back of his head there was form a plan to take a small theater at jeffersonvill if the girl made a hit there . eshwel , to whom he was talk , look glum . `` she 's go pretti good with these greeni , '' observ he . `` but i ve my doubt whether citi peopl ll care for anyth so milk-lik . '' burlingham had his doubt , too ; but he retort warm : `` don't you believ it , eshi . citi 's an outsid . underneath , there still the simpl , honest , grassy-green heart of the countri . '' eshwel laugh . `` so you ve stop jeer at jay . you'v forgotten what a lot of tightwad and petti swindler they are . well , i do n't blame you . now that they re give down to us so freeli , i feel better about them myself . it 's a piti we can't lower the rest of the program to the level of their intellectu . '' burlingham was not tactless enough to disturb eshwel consol notion that while susan was appreci by these ignor country-jak , the rest of the compani were too subtl and refin in their art . `` that 's a good idea , '' repli he . `` i ll tri to get togeth some simpl slop . perhap a melodrama , a good hot one , would go -- eh ? '' after ten day the receipt began to drop . on the fifteenth day there was onli a hand at the matine , and in the even half the bench were empti . `` about milk dri , '' said burlingham at the late supper . `` we ll move on in the morn . '' this pleas everyon . susan saw vision of bigger triumph ; the other felt that they were go where dramat talent , not to say genius , would be at least not entir unappreci . so the compani was at it liveliest next morn as the mosquito-infest willow of the bethlehem shore slowli drop away . they had made an unusu earli start , for the river would be more and more crowd as they near the three close-set citi -- louisvill , jeffersonvill , and new albani , and the helpless littl show boat must give the steamer no excus for not see her . all day -- a long , dreami , summer day -- they drift lazili downstream , and , except tempest , all grew gayer and more gay . burlingham had announc that there were three hundr and seventy-eight dollar in the japan tin box he kept shut up in his bag . at dusk a tug , for three dollar , nose them into a wharf which adjoin the thick popul labor quarter of jeffersonvill . susan was awaken by a scream . even as she open her eye a dark cloud , a dull suffoc terrifi pain , descend upon her . when she again becam conscious , she was lie upon a mass of canva on the leve with three strang men bend over her . she sat up , instinct caught togeth the front of the nightdress she had bought in bethlehem the second day there . then she look wild from face to face . `` you re all right , ma'am , '' said one of the men . `` not a scratch -- onli stun . '' `` what was it ? '' said the girl . `` where are they ? '' as she spoke , she saw burlingham in his nightshirt prop against a big blue oil barrel . he was stare stupid at the ground . and now she note the other scatter about the leve , each with a group around him or her . `` what was it ? '' she repeat . `` a tug but it tow of barg into you , '' said someon . `` crush your boat like an eggshel . '' burlingham stagger to his feet , stare round , saw her . `` thank god ! '' he cri . `` anyon drown ? anyon hurt ? '' `` all save -- no bone broken , '' someon respond . `` and the boat ? '' `` gone down . noth left of her but splinter . the barg were full of coal and build stone . '' `` the box ! '' sudden shout burlingham . `` the box ! '' `` what kind of a box ? '' ask a boy with lean , dirti , and much scratch bare leg . `` a littl black tin box like they keep money in ? '' `` that 's it . where is it ? '' `` it 's all right , '' said the boy . `` one of your peopl , a black actor-look fellow -- -- '' '' tempest , '' interject burlingham . `` go on . '' `` he dress on the wharf and he had the box . '' `` where is he ? '' `` he said he was go for a doctor . last i seed of him he was up to the corner yonder . he was movin ' fast . '' burlingham gave a kind of groan . susan read in his face his fear , his suspicion -- the suspicion he was asham of himself for have . she note vagu that he talk with the policeman asid for a few minut , after which the policeman went up the leve . burlingham rejoin his companion and took command . the first thing was to get dress as well as might be from such of the trunk as had been knock out of the cabin by the barg and had been pick up . they were all daze . even burlingham could not realiz just what had occur . they call to one anoth more or less humor remark while they were dress behind pile of box , crate , barrel and sack in the wharf-boat . and they laugh gayli when they assembl . susan made the best appear , for her blue serg suit had been taken out dri when she herself was lift from the sink wreck ; the nightgown serv as a blous . mabel 's trunk had been save . violet could wear none of her thing , as they were mani size too small , so she appear in a properti skirt of black paper muslin , a black velvet properti basqu , a pair of shoe belong to tempest . burlingham and eshwel made a fair respect show in cloth from tempest 's trunk . their own trunk had gone down . `` whi , where 's tempest ? '' ask eshwel . `` he ll be back in a few minut , '' repli burlingham . `` in fact , he ought to be back now . '' his glanc happen to meet susan 's ; he hastili shift his eye . `` where 's the box ? '' ask violet . `` tempest 's take care of it , '' was the manag 's answer . `` tempest ! '' exclaim mabel . her shrewd , dissip eye contract with suspicion . `` anybodi got ani money ? '' inquir eshwel , as he fish in his pocket . no one had a cent . eshwel search tempest 's trunk , found a two-dollar bill and a one wrap round a silver dollar and wad in among some rag undercloth . susan heard burlingham mutter `` wonder how he happen to overlook that ! '' but no one els heard . `` well , we might have breakfast , '' suggest mabel . they went out on the water deck of the wharf-boat , look down at the splinter of the wreck lie in the deep yellow river . `` come on , '' said burlingham , and he led the way up the leve . there was no attempt at jaunti ; they all realiz now . `` how about tempest ? '' said eshwel , stop short halfway up . `` tempest -- hell ! '' retort mabel . `` come on . '' `` what do you mean ? '' cri violet , whose left eye was almost close by a bruis . `` we ll not see him again . come on . '' `` bob ! '' shriek violet at burlingham . `` do you hear that ? '' `` yes , '' said he . `` keep calm , and come on . '' `` are n't you go to _do_ anyth ? '' she scream , seiz him by the coat tail . `` you must , damn it -- you must ! '' `` i got the policeman to telephon headquart , '' said burlingham . `` what els can be done ? come on . '' and a moment later the bedraggl and deject compani file into a cheap leve restaur . `` bring some coffe , '' burlingham said to the waiter . then to the other , `` doe anybodi want anyth els ? '' no one spoke . `` coffe 's all , '' he said to the waiter . it came , and they drank it in silenc , each one 's brain busi with the disast from the standpoint of his own result ruin . susan glanc furtiv at each face in turn . she could not think of her own fate , there was such despair in the face of these other . mabel look like an old woman . as for violet , everi featur of her homeli , her coars , her dissip prematur old age stood forth in all it horror . susan 's heart contract and her flesh crept as she glanc quick away . but she still saw , and it was mani a week befor she ceas to see whenev violet 's name came into her mind . burlingham , too , look old and broken . eshwel and pat , neither of whom had ever had the smallest tast of success , were stolid , like corner cur take their beat and wait in silenc for the blow to stop . `` here , eshi , '' said the manag , `` take care of the three dollar . '' and he hand him the bill . `` i ll pay for the coffe and keep the chang . i 'm go down to the owner of that tug and see what i can do . '' when he had paid they follow him out . at the curbston he said , `` keep togeth somewher round the wharf-boat . so long . '' he lift the batter hat he was wear , smile at susan . `` cheer up , miss sackvill . we ll down em yet ! '' and away he went -- a strang figur , his bur frame squeez into a dingi old frock suit from among tempest 's costum . a dreari two hour , the last half-hour in a drizzl rain from which the narrow eav of the now close and lock wharf-boat shelter them onli a littl . `` there he come ! '' cri susan ; and sure enough , burlingham separ from the crowd stream along the street at the top of the leve , and began to descend the slope toward them . they concentr on his face , hope to get some indic of what to expect ; but he never permit his face to betray his mind . he strode up the plank and join them . `` tempest come ? '' he ask . `` tempest ! '' cri mabel . `` have n't i told you he 's jump ? don't you suppos _i_ know him ? '' `` and you brought him into the compani , '' rage violet . `` burlingham did n't want to take him . he look the fool and jackass he is . whi did n't you warn us he was a rotten thief , too ? '' `` was n't it for shoplift you serv six month in joliet ? '' retort mabel . `` you lie -- you streetwalk ! '' scream violet . `` ladi ! ladi ! '' said eshwel . `` that 's what _i_ say , '' observ pat . `` i 'm no ladi , '' repli mabel . `` i 'm an actress . '' `` an actress -- he-h ! '' jeer violet . `` an actress ! '' `` shut up , all of you , '' command burlingham . `` i ve got some money . i settl for cash . '' `` how much ? '' cri mabel and violet in the same breath , their quarrel not mere finish but forgotten . `` three hundr dollar . '' `` for the boat and all ? '' demand eshwel . `` whi , bob -- -- '' '' they think it was for boat and all , '' interrupt burlingham with his cynic smile . `` they set out to bulli and cheat me . they knew i could n't get justic . so i let em believ i own the boat -- and i ve got fifti apiec for us . '' `` sixti , '' said violet . `` fifti . there are six of us . '' `` you do n't count in this littl jonah here , do you ? '' cri violet , scowl evilli at susan . `` no -- no -- do n't count me in , '' beg susan . `` i did n't lose anyth . '' mabel pinch her arm . `` you re right , mr. burlingham , '' said she . `` miss sackvill ought to share . we re all in the same box . '' `` miss sackvill will share , '' said burlingham . `` there 's go to be no skunk about this , as long as i 'm in charg . '' eshwel and pat side with violet . while the rain stream , the five , with susan a horrifi onlook , fought on and on about the divis of the money . their voic grew louder . they hurl the most fright epithet at one anoth . violet seiz mabel by the hair , and the men interf , all but come to blow themselv in the mele . the wharfmast rush from his offic , drove them off to the leve . they continu to yell and curs , even burlingham lose control of himself and releas all there was of the tough and the blackguard in his natur . two policemen came , calm them with threat of arrest . at last burlingham took from his pocket one at a time three small roll of bill . he flung one at each of the three who were oppos his divis . `` take that , you dirti cur , '' he said . `` and be glad i 'm give you anyth at all . most manag would n't have come back . come on , miss sackvill . come on , mabel . '' and the two follow him up the leve , leav the other count their share . at the street corner they went into a general store where burlingham bought two ninety-eight-c umbrella . he gave mabel one , held the other over susan and himself as they walk along . `` well , ladi , '' said he , `` we begin life again . a clean slate , a fresh start -- as if noth had ever happen . '' susan look at him to tri to give him a grate and sympathet smile . she was surpris to see that , so far as she could judg , he had realli meant the word he had spoken . `` yes , i mean it , '' said he . `` alway look at life as it is -- as a game . with everi deal , whether you win or lose , your stake grow -- for your stake 's your wit , and you add to em by learn someth with each deal . what are you go to do , mabel ? '' `` get some cloth . the water wreck mine and this rain has finish my hat . '' `` we ll go togeth , '' said burlingham . they took a car for louisvill , descend befor a depart store . burlingham had to fit himself from the skin out ; mabel had undercloth , need a hat , a dress , summer shoe . susan need undercloth , shoe , a hat , for she was barehead . they arrang to meet at the first entranc down the side street ; burlingham gave susan and mabel each their fifti dollar and went his way . when they met again in an hour and a half , they burst into smile of delight . burlingham had transform himself into a jaunti , fashion young middle-ag man , with an air of success achiev and prosper assur . he had put the fine finish touch to his transform by get a haircut and a shave . mabel look like a showi chorus girl , in a stripe blue and white linen suit , a big beflow hat , and a fluffi blous of white chiffon . susan had resist mabel 's entreati , had got a plain , sensibl linen blous of a kind that on a pinch might be wash out and worn without iron . her new hat was a simpl blue sailor with a dark blue band that match her dress . `` i spent thirty-six dollar , '' said burlingham . `` i onli spent twenty-two , '' declar mabel . `` and this child here onli part with seven of her dollar . i had no idea she was so thrifti . '' `` and now -- what ? '' said burlingham . `` i 'm go round to see a friend of mine , '' repli mabel . `` she on the stage , too . there 's sure to be someth do at the summer place . mayb i can ring miss sackvill in . there ought to be a good live in those eye of her and those feet and ankl . i 'm sure i can put her next to someth .

'' `` no , she 's go with me to a board hous i ll find for her , '' said burlingham . into mabel 's face flash the express of the suspicion such a statement would at onc arous in a mind train as her had been . burlingham 's look drove the express out of her face , and suspicion at least into the background . `` she 's not go with your friend , '' said burlingham , a hint of stern in his voic . `` that 's best -- is n't it ? '' miss connemora 's eye drop . `` yes , i guess it is , '' repli she . `` well -- i turn down this way . '' `` we ll keep on and go out chestnut street , '' said burlingham . `` you can write to her -- or to me -- care of the general deliveri . '' `` that 's best . you may hear from tempest . you can write me there , too . '' mabel was constrain and embarrass . `` good-bi , miss sackvill .

'' chapter xvi burlingham found for her a comfort room in a flat in west chestnut street -- a respect middle-class neighborhood with three church in full view and the spire of two other visibl over the housetop . her landladi was mrs. red , a simple-heart , deaf old widow with bright kind eye beam guileless through steel-fram spectacl . mrs. red had onli recent been reduc to the necess of let a room . she state her moder price -- seven dollar a week for room and board -- as if she expect to be arrest for attempt extort . `` i give good meal , '' she hasten to add . `` i do the cook myself -- and buy the best . i 'm no hand for can stuff . as for that there cold storag , it 's no better'n slow poison , and not so terribl slow at that . anyth your daughter want i ll give her . '' `` she 's not my daughter , '' said burlingham , and it was his turn to be red and fluster . `` i 'm simpli look after her , as she alon in the world . i 'm go to live somewher els . but i'll come here for meal , if you re will , ma'am . '' `` i -- i 'd have to make that extri , i 'm afraid , '' plead mrs. red . `` rather ! '' exclaim burlingham . `` i eat like a pair of percheron . '' `` how much did you calcul to pay ? '' inquir the widow . her one effort at price fix , though entir success , had exhaust her courag . burlingham was clear out of his class in those idyl day of protector of innoc . he proceed to be more than honest . `` oh , say five a week . '' `` gracious ! that 's too much , '' protest she . `` i hate to charg a bodi for food , somehow . it do n't seem to be accordin ' to what god tell us . but i do n't see no way out . '' `` i ll come for five not a cent less , '' insist burlingham . `` i want to feel free to eat as much as i like . '' and it was so arrang . away he went to look up his acquaint , while susan sat listen to the widow and tri to convinc her that she and mr. burlingham did n't want and could n't possibl eat all the thing she suggest as suitabl for a nice supper . susan had been learn rapid sinc she join the theatric profess . she saw whi this fine old woman was get poorer steadili , was arrang to spend her last year in an almshous . what a queer world it was ! what a strang way for a good god to order thing ! the better you were , the wors off you were . no doubt it was burlingham 's lifelong good of heart as shown in his generos to her , that had kept him down . it was the same way with her dead mother -- she had been love and trust , had given generous without thought of self , with generous confid in the man she love -- and had paid with reput and life . she compel burlingham to take what was left of her fifti dollar . `` you would n't like to make me feel mean , '' was the argument she use . `` i must put in what i ve got -- the same as you do . now , is n't that fair ? '' and as he was dead broke and had been unabl to borrow , he did not oppos vigor . she assum that after a day or two spent in get his bear he would take her with him as he went look . when she suggest it , he prompt veto it . `` that is n't the way busi is done in the profess , '' said he . `` the star -- you'r the star -- keep in the background , and her manag -- that 's me doe the hustl . '' she had everi reason for believ this ; but as the day pass with no result , sit about wait began to get upon her nerv . mrs. red had the remnant of her dead husband librari , and he had been a man of broad tast in literatur . but susan , ardent reader though she was , could not often lose herself in book now . she was too impati for realiti , too anxious about them . burlingham remain equabl , neither hope nor gloomi ; he made her feel that he was strong , and it gave her strength . thus she was not depress when on the last day of their week he said : `` i think we 'd better push on to cincinnati tomorrow . there noth here , and we ve got to get place befor our cash give out . in cincinnati there are a dozen place to one in this snide town . '' the idea of go to cincinnati gave her a qualm of fear ; but it pass away when she consid how she had drop out of the world . `` they think i 'm dead , '' she reflect . `` anyhow , i'd never be look for among the kind of peopl i 'm in with now . '' the past with which she had broken seem so far away and so dim to her that she could not but feel it must seem so to those who knew her in her former life . she had such a sens of her own insignific , now that she knew someth of the vast and busi of the world , that she was without a suspicion of the huge scandal and excit her disappear had caus in sutherland . to cincinnati they went next day by the l. and n. and took two tini room in the dingi old walnut street hous , at a special rate -- five dollar a week for the two , as a concess to the profess . `` we ll eat in cheap restaur and spread our capit out , '' said burlingham . `` i want you to get place _right_ , not just place . '' he bought a box of black and a brush , instruct her in the subtl art of make a front -- an art whereof he was past master , as susan had long sinc learn . `` never let yourself look poor or act poor , until you simpli have to throw up the spong , '' said he . `` the world judg by appear . put your first money and your last into cloth . and never -- never -- tell a hard-luck stori . alway seem to be do well and comfort look out for a chanc to do better . the whole world run from seedi peopl and whimper . '' `` am i -- that way ? '' she ask nervous . `` not a bit , '' declar he . `` the day you came up to me in carrollton i knew you were play in the hardest kind of hard luck becaus of what i had happen to see and hear -- and guess . but you were n't look for piti -- and that was what i like . and it made me feel you had the stuff in you . i 'd not wast breath teach a whiner or a cheap skate . you could n't be cheap if you tri . the reason i talk to you about these thing is so you'll learn to put the artist touch by instinct into what you do . '' `` you ve taken too much troubl for me , '' said the girl . `` do n't you believ it , my dear , '' laugh he . `` if i can do with you what i hope -- i ve an instinct that if i win out for you , i'll come into my own at last . '' `` you ve taught me a lot , '' said she . `` i wonder , '' repli he . `` that is , i wonder how much you'v learn . perhap enough to keep you -- not to keep from be knock down by fate , but to get on your feet afterward . i hope so -- i hope so . '' they drop coffe , bought milk by the bottl , he smuggl it to their room disguis as a roll of newspap . they carri in roll also , and cut down their restaur meal to supper which they got for twenty-f cent apiec at a bakeri restaur in seventh street . there is a way of resort to these littl economi -- a snobbish , self-despair way -- that make them sordid and make the person indulg in them sink lower and lower . but burlingham could not have taken that way . he was the adventur born , was a hardi season campaign who had never look on life in the snob 's way , had never felt the impuls to apolog for his defeat or to grow haughti over his success . susan was an apt pupil ; and for the career that lay befor her his instruct were invalu . he was teach her how to keep the craft afloat and shipshap through the worst weather that can sweep the sea of life . `` how do you make yourself look alway neat and clean ? '' he ask . she confess : `` i wash out my thing at night and hang them on the insid of the shutter to dri . they re readi to wear again in the morn . '' `` get on ! '' cri he , full of admir . `` they simpli can't down us , and they might as well give up tri . '' `` but i do n't look neat , '' sigh she . `` i ca n't iron . '' `` no -- that 's the devil of it , '' laugh he . he pull asid his waistcoat and she saw he was wear a dickey . `` and my cuff are pin in , '' he said . `` i have to be care about rais and lower my arm . '' `` ca n't i wash out some thing for you ? '' she said , then hurri on to put it more strong . `` yes , give them to me when we get back to the hotel . '' `` it doe help a man to feel he 's clean underneath . and we ve got noth to wast on laundri . '' `` i wish i had n't spent that fifteen cent to have my heel straighten and new steel put in them . '' she had sat in a cobbler 's while this repair to the part of her person she was most insist upon had been effect . he laugh . `` a good invest , that , '' said he . `` i ve been notic how you alway look nice about the feet . keep it up . the surest sign of a sloven and a failur , of a moral , mental , and physic no-good is down-at-the-heel . alway keep your heel straight , lorna . '' and never had he given her a piec of advic more to her like . she thought she knew now whi she had alway been so particular about her boot and shoe , her slipper and her stock . he had given her a new confid in herself -- in a strength within her somewher beneath the weak she was alway see and feel . not until she thought it out afterward did she realiz what they were pass through , what fright day of failur he was endur . he act like the steady-nerv gambler at life that he was . he was not one of those more or less weak loser who have to make desper effort to conceal a faint heart . his heart was not faint . he simpli play calm on , feel that the next throw was as like to be for as against him . she kept close to her room , walk about there -- she had never been much of a sitter -- think , practic the new song he had got for her -- charact song in which he train her as well as he could without music or costum or ani of the accessori . he also had an idea for a church scene , with her in a choir boy 's costum , sing the most move of the simpl religi song to organ music . she from time to time urg him to take her on the round with him . but he stood firm , give alway the same reason of the custom in the profess . gradual , perhap by some form of that curious process of infiltr that goe on between two mind long in intim contact , the convict came to her that the reason he alleg was not his real reason ; but as she had absolut confid in him she felt that there was some good reason or he would not keep her in the background -- and that his silenc about it must be respect . so she tri to hide from him how weari and heartsick inact was make her , how hard it was for her to stay alon so mani hour each day . as he watch her close , it soon dawn on him that someth was wrong , and after a day or so he work out the explan . he found a remedi -- the read room of the public librari where she could make herself almost content the whole day long . he began to have a haggard look , and she saw he was sick , was keep up his strength with whiski . `` it 's onli this infern summer cold i caught in the smashup , '' he explain . `` i can't shake it , but neither can it get me down . i 'd not dare fall sick . what 'd becom of _us_ ? '' she knew that `` us '' meant onli herself . her mind had been age rapid in those long period of unbroken reflect . to develop a human be , leav him or her alon most of the time ; it is too much compani , too littl time to digest and assimil , that keep us thoughtless and unform until life is half over . she astonish him by sudden announc one even : '' i am a drag on you . i 'm go to take a place in a store . '' he affect an indign so artist that it ought to have been convinc . `` i 'm asham of you ! '' he cri . `` i see you'r lose your nerv .

'' susan hope so , but doubt it . there was no time to work at these larg problem of destini when the daili grind was so compel , so wear , when the problem of bare food , cloth and shelter took all there was in her . for exampl , there was the matter of cloth . she had come with onli what she was wear . she gave the brashear everi saturday two dollar and a half of her three and was asham of herself for take so much for so littl , when she learn about the cost of live and how differ was the food the brashear had from that of ani other famili in those quarter ! as soon as she had save four dollar from her wage -- it took near two month -- she bought the necessari materi and made herself two plain outer skirt , three blous and three pair of drawer . chemis and corset cover she could not afford . she bought a pair of shoe for a dollar , two pair of stock for thirti cent , a corset for eighti cent , an umbrella for half a dollar , two underwaist for a quarter . she bought an untrim hat for thirty-f cent and trim it with the clean ribbon from her summer sailor and a left over bit of skirt materi . she also made herself a jacket that had to serv as wrap too -- and the materi for this took the surplus of her wage for anoth month . the cold weather had come , and she had to walk fast when she was in the open air not to be chill to the bone . her aunt fanni had been one of those women , not too common in america , who understand and practic genuin economi in the household -- not the shabbi stingi that pass for economi but the lay out of money to the best advantag that come onli when one know valu . this train stood susan in good stead now . it save her from disast -- from disintegr . she and etta did some wash everi night , hang the thing on the fire escap to dri . in this way she was abl to be clean ; but in appear she look as poor as she was . she found a cobbler who kept her shoe in fair order for a few cent ; but noth was right about them soon -- except that they were not down at the heel . she could recal how she had often wonder whi the poor girl at sutherland show so littl tast , look so dowdi . she wonder at her own stupid , at the narrow of an educ , such as her had been , an educ that left her ignor of the condit of life as it was live by all but a lucki few of her fellow be . how few the lucki ! what an amaz world -- what a strang creation the human race ! how was it possibl that the lucki few , among whom she had been born and bred , should know so littl , realli noth , about the lot of the vast mass of their fellow , live all around them , close up against them ? `` if i had onli known ! '' she thought . and then she reflect that , if she had known , pleasur would have been imposs . she could see her bureau drawer , her closet at home . she had thought herself not ani too well off . now , how luxuri , how stuf with shame , wast unnecessari those drawer and closet seem ! and mere to keep herself in undercloth that were at least not in tatter she had to spend everi cent over and abov her board . if she had had to pay carfar ten cent a day , sixti cent a week ! -- as did mani of the girl who live at home , she would have been ruin . she understood now whi everi girl without a famili back of her , and without good prospect of marriag , was revolv the idea of becom a streetwalk -- not as a hope , but as a fear . as she learn to observ more close , she found good reason for suspect that from time to time the girl who becam too hard press reliev the tension by take to the street on saturday and sunday night . she read in the _commercial_ one noon -- mr. matson sometim left his paper where she could glanc through it -- she read an articl on work girl , how they were seduc to live of shame -- by love of _finery_ ! then she read that those who did not fall were restrain by religion and innat puriti . there she laugh -- bitter . fear of diseas , fear of matern , yes . but where was this religion ? who but the dullest fool in the throe of that bare and tortur life ever thought of god ? as for the puriti -- what about the obscen talk that made her shudder becaus of it sheer filthi stupid ? -- what about the frank shameless of the effort to lure their `` steadi '' into speedi matrimoni by use everi charm of caress and of person to inflam passion without satisfi it ? she had thought she knew about the relat of the sex when she came to live and work in that tenement quarter . soon her knowledg had seem ignor besid the knowledg of the veri babi . it was a sad , sad puzzl . if one ought to be good -- chast and clean in mind and bodi -- then , whi was there the most tremend pressur on all but a few to make them as foul as the surround in which they were compel to live ? if it was wiser to be good , then whi were most peopl imprison in a life from which they could escap onli by be bad ? what was this thing comfort peopl had set up as good , anyhow -- and what was bad ? she found no answer . how could god condemn anyon for anyth they did in the torment of the hell that life reveal itself to her as be , after a few week of it moral , mental and physic horror ? etta 's father was right ; those who realiz what life realli was and what it might be , those who were sensit took to drink or went to piec some other way , if they were gentl , and if they were cruel , commit ani brutal , ani crime to tri to escap . in former day susan thought well of chariti , as she had been taught . old tom brashear gave her a differ point of view . one day he insult and drove from the tenement some pious charit peopl who had come down from the fashion hilltop to be good and gracious to their `` less fashion fellow-b . '' after they had gone he explain his harsh to susan : '' that 's the onli way you can make them slicked-up brute feel , '' said he , `` they re so thick in the hide and satisfi with themselv . what do they come here for ! to do good ! yes -- to themselv . to make themselv feel how generous and sweet they was . well , they 'd better go home and read their russia-leath cover bibl . they 'd find out that when god want to realli do someth for man , he did n't have himself creat a king , or a plutocrat , or a fat , slimi church deacon in a fashion church . no , he had himself born a bastard in a manger . '' susan shiver , for the truth thus put sound like sacrileg . then a glow -- a glow of pride and of hope -- swept through her . `` if you ever get up into anoth class , '' went on old tom , `` don't come hangin ' round the common peopl you ll be livin ' off of and helpin ' to grind down ; stick to your own class . that 's the onli place anybodi can do ani good -- ani real helpin ' and lovin ' , man to man , and woman to woman . if you want to help anybodi that down , pull him up into your class first . stick to your class . you ll find plenti to do there .

'' `` i see , '' said susan . `` that 's it exact , '' exclaim the old man , in triumph . `` and i say to them pious chariti faker , git the hell out of here where you ca n't do no good . git back to yer own class that make all this miseri , make it faster'n all the religion and chariti in the world could help it . git back to yer own class and work with them , and teach them and make them stop robbin ' and beatin the babi .

'' susan had long sinc lost power to be shock by ani revel of the do of peopl lash out of all civil feel by the incess brutal whip of poverti and driven back to the state of natur . she had never happen to hear definit of this habit -- even custom -- of incestu relat ; now that she heard , she instant accept it as someth of which she had realli known for some time . at ani rate , she had no sens of shock . she felt no horror , no deep disgust , simpli the distast into which her origin sens of horror had been thin down by constant contact with poverti 's condit -- just as filth no longer made her shudder , so long as it did not touch her own person . `` you 'd better go and chase yourself round the squar a few time , '' said she , turn away and take up some mend . `` you see , there ai n't no way out of it , '' pursu he , with an insinu grin . susan gave him a steadi , straight look . `` do n't ever speak of it again , '' said she quiet . `` you ought to be asham -- and you will be when you think it over .

'' `` yes , _it's_ got to go , '' said etta . `` and we ve got to pay mrs. quinlan the six we owe her and get out tonight . we ll go up to the top floor -- up to mrs. cassatt . she take sleeper . then -- we ll see . '' an hour later they had move ; for mrs. quinlan was abl to find two lodger to take the room at onc . they were establish with mrs. cassatt , had a foul and foul-smel bed and one-half of her back room ; the other half bare contain two even dirtier and more malodor cot , in one of which slept mrs. cassatt 's sixteen-year-old daughter kate , in the other her fourteen-year-old son dan . for these new quarter and the right to cook their food on the cassatt stove the girl agre to pay three dollar and a half a week -- which left them three dollar and a half a week for food and cloth -- and for recreat and for the exercis of the virtu of thrift which the comfort so assidu urg upon the poor . chapter xxi each girl now had with her at all time everyth she possess in the world -- a toothbrush , a cake of castil soap , the littl money left out of the week 's wage , these three item in the pocket of her one skirt , a cheap dark blue cloth much wrinkl and patch ; a twenty-f cent felt hat , susan 's adorn with a blue ribbon , etta 's with a bunch of fade rose ; a blue cotton blous patch under the arm with stuff of a differ shade ; an old misshapen corset that cost forty-nin cent in a bargain sale ; a suit of gray shoddy-and-wool underwear ; a pair of fifteen-c stock , susan 's brown , etta 's black ; a pair of worn and torn tie , scuf and down at the heel , bought for a dollar and nine cent ; a dirt-stain dark blue jacket , susan lack one button , etta 's lack three and have a patch under the right arm . yet they often laugh and joke with each other , with their fellow-work . you might have said their heart were light ; for so eager are we to believ our fellow-b comfort , a smile of poverti 's face convinc us straightway that it is as happi as we , if not happier . there would have been to their mirth a littl more than mere surfac and youth abil to find some jest in the most crush tragedi if onli they could have kept themselv clean . the lack of suffici food was a sever trial , for both had voraci appetit ; etta was torment by vision of quantiti , susan by vision of qualiti as well as of quantiti . but onli at meal time , or when they had to omit a meal entir , were they keen distress by the food question . the cold was a still sever trial ; but it was warm in the factori and it was warm in mrs. cassatt 's flat , whose window were never open from close in of winter until spring came round . the inabl to keep clean was the trial of trial . from her begin at the box factori the physic unclean of the other girl had made susan suffer keen . and her suffer can be understood onli by a clean person who has been through the same ordeal . she knew that her fellow-work were not to blame . she even envi them the ignor and the insens that enabl them to bear what , she was convinc , could never be chang . she wonder sometim at the strength and grip of the religi belief among the girl -- even , or , rather , especi , among those who had stray from virtu into the path their priest and preacher and rabbi told them was the most sin of all stray . but she also saw mani sign that religion was fast lose it hold . one day a lutheran girl , emma schmeltz , said dure a monday morn lunch talk : '' well , anyhow , i believ it 's all a probat , and everything'l be made right hereaft . _i_ believ my religion , i do . yes , we ll be reward in the hereaft . '' becki -- rebecca lichtenspiel -- laugh , as did most of the girl . said becki : '' and there ai n't no hereaft . did you ever see a corps ? ain't they the dead one ! do n't talk to me about no hereaft . '' everybodi laugh . but this was a monday morn convers , high abov the averag of the girl ' talk in intellig and liveli . their mind had been stimul by the sunday rest from the dreari and degener drudgeri of `` honest toil . '' it was the physic contact that most prey upon susan . she was too gentl , too consider to show her feel ; in her determin and success effort to conceal them she at time went to the opposit extrem and not onli endur but even court contact that were littl short of loathsom . tongu could not tell what she suffer through the persist affection of letti southard , a sweet and pretti young girl of wretch poor famili who develop an enorm like for her . letti , dirti and clad in noisom undergar beneath soil rag and patch , was alway hug and kiss her -- and not to have submit would have been to stab poor letti to the heart and humili all the other girl . so no one , not even etta , suspect what she was go through . from her come to the factori in the morn , to hang her hat and jacket in the onli possibl place , along with the soil and smell and often vermin-infect wrap of the other -- from earli morn until she left at night she was forc into contact to which custom never in the least blunt her . howev , so long as she had a home with the brashear there was the night respit . but now -- there was littl water , and onli a crack and filthi basin to wash in . there was no chanc to do laundri work ; for their undercloth must be use as night cloth also . to wash their hair was imposs . `` doe my hair smell as bad as your ? '' said etta . `` you needn't think your is clean becaus it doe n't show the dirt like mine . '' `` doe my hair smell as bad as the rest of the girl ' ? '' said susan . `` not quit , '' was etta 's consol repli . by make desper effort they contriv partial to wash their bodi onc a week , not without interrupt of privaci -- to which , howev , they soon grew accustom . in spite of effort which were liter heroic , they could not alway keep free from parasit ; for the whole tenement and all person and thing in it were infect -- and how could it be otherwis where no one had time or money or ani effect mean whatsoev to combat natur 's inflex determin to breed wherev there is a breed spot ? the last trace of civil were slip from the two girl ; they were sink to a state of natur . even person pride , power in susan and strong in etta through susan 's exampl , was desert them . they no longer mind dan 's sleep in their room . they saw him , his father , the other member of the famili in all stage of nuditi and at the most privat act ; and they were seen by the cassatt in the same way . to avoid this was imposs , as imposs as to avoid the parasit swarm in the bed , in the woodwork , in crack of ceil , wall , floor . the cassatt were an exampl of how much the peopl who live in the shelter and more or less sunni nook owe to their shelter and how littl to their own boast superior of mind and soul . they had been a high class artisan famili until a few month befor . the hard time struck them a seri of quick , savag blow , such as are commonplac enough under our social system , intric becaus a crude jumbl of makeshift , and easili disord becaus intric . they were swept without a breath paus down to the bottom . those who have alway been accustom to prosper have no reserv of experi or courag to enabl them to recuper from sudden and extrem advers . in an amaz short time the cassatt had becom demor -- a familiar illustr of how civil is mere a wafer-thin veneer over most human be as yet . over how mani is it more ? they fought after a fashion ; they fought valiant . but how would it have been possibl not steadili to yield ground against such a pitiless , power foe as poverti ? the man had taken to drink , to blunt outrag self-respect and to numb his despair befor the spectacl of his famili downfal . mrs. cassatt was as poor a manag as the averag woman in whatev walk of life , thank to the habit of educ woman in the most slipshod fashion , if at all , in ani other part of the busi but sex-trickeri . thus she was helpless befor the tenement condit . she gave up , went sodden about in rag with an incred greasi and usual dangl tail of hair . `` whi do n't you tie up that tail , ma ? '' said the son dan , who had idea about neat . `` what 's the use ? '' said mrs. cassatt . `` what 's the use of _anything_ ? '' `` ma do n't want to look stylish and stuck up , '' said the daughter . mrs. cassatt 's haunt terror was lest someon who had known them in the day of their prosper with a decent furnish littl hous of their own should run into one of the famili now . kate , the sixteen-year-old had a place as salesladi in a big shop in fifth , street ; her six dollar a week was the famili entir steadi incom . she had former possess a good deal of fineri for a girl in her posit , though realli not much more than the daughter of the averag prosper artisan or small shopkeep expect , and is expect , to have . be at the shop where fineri was all the talk and sight and thought from open until close had develop in her a greedi tast for luxuri . she pilfer from the stock of good within her reach and exchang her steal for the steal of girl who happen to be abl to get thing more to her like or need . but now that the famili save -- bank account was exhaust , all these pilfer had to go at onc to the pawnshop . kate grew more and more ill-temp as the famili sank . former she had been note for her amiabl , for her vaniti easili pleas with a careless compliment from no matter whom -- a jocos , half-drunken ash man , half-jeer , half-admir from his cart seat quit as satisfactori as anybodi . but poverti was bring out in her all those meanest and most selfish and most brutish instinct -- those primal instinct of human natur that civil has slowli been subject to the process of atrophi which has lost us such other primal attribut as , for exampl , prehensil toe and a cover of hair . `` well , i for one do n't have to stay in this slop barrel , '' kate was alway say . `` some fine morn i ll turn up miss -- and you ll see me in my own turnout . '' she was tortur her mother and father with the dread that she would leav the famili in the lurch and enter a hous of prostitut . she recount with the utmost detail how the madam of a hous in longworth street came from time to time to her counter in the perfumeri and soap depart -- and urg her to '' stop make a fool of yourself and come get good money for your look befor you lose em drudg behind a counter . '' the idea grew less abhorr , took on allur as the degrad of tenement life ate out respect for convent restraint -- for modesti , for virtu , for clean of speech , and the rest . more and more bold kate was announc that she was n't go to be a fool much longer . dan , the fourteen-year-old boy , had attract the attent of what cassatt call `` a fanci ladi '' who live two floor below them . she made sometim as much as nine or ten dollar a week and slept all day or loung comfort about in showi , tawdri stuff that in those surround seem eleg luxuri . she was caught by the boy 's young beauti and strength , and was rapid train him in everi vice and was fit him to becom a profession seduc and `` lover . '' said mrs. cassatt in one of her noisi wail appeal to dan : '' you better keep away from that there soil dove . they tell me she 's a thief -- has done time -- has rob drunken men in dark hallway . '' dan laugh impud . `` she 's a cute one . what diff doe it make how she get the good as long as she get it ? '' mrs. cassatt confid to everybodi that she was afraid the woman would make a thief of her boy -- and there was no disput the justic of her forebod . foul smell and sight everywher , and foul languag ; no privaci , no possibl of modesti where all must do all in the same room : vermin , parasit , bad food vile cook -- in the midst of these and a multitud of similar ill how was it possibl to maintain a human standard , even if one had by chanc acquir a knowledg of what constitut a human standard ? the cassatt were sink into the slime in which their neighbor were alreadi wallow . but there was this differ . for the cassatt it was a descent ; for mani of their neighbor it was an ascent -- for the immigr notabl , who had been wors off in their european home ; in this land not yet complet in the grip of the capitalist or wage system they were now get the first notion of decenc and develop , the first view and hope of rise in the world . the cassatt , though they had alway live too near the slime to be nauseat by it , still found it disagre and in spot disgust . their neighbor -- one of the chief reason whi these peopl were rise so slowli where they were rise at all was that the slime seem to them natur , and to tri to get clean of it seem rather a foolish , finicki wast of time and effort . peopl who have come up -- by accid , or by their own forc , or by the forc of some at onc shrewd and brutal member of the famili -- have to be far and long from the slum befor they lose the sens that in conform to the decenc of life they are make absurd effemin concess . when they go to buy a toothbrush they blush and stammer . `` look at lorna and etta , '' mrs. cassatt was alway say to kate . `` well , i see em , '' kate would repli . `` and i do n't see much . '' `` ai n't you asham of yourself ! '' cri the mother . `` them two live straight and decent . and you re better off than they are . '' `` do n't preach to me , ma , '' sneer kate . `` when i get readi i ll -- stop make a damn fool of myself . '' but the exampl of the two girl was not without it effect . they , struggl on in chastiti against appal odd , becam the model , not onli to mrs. cassatt , but all the mother of that row held up to their daughter . the mother -- all of them by observ , not a few by experi -- knew what the `` fanci ladi 's '' life realli meant . and they strove mightili to keep their daughter from it . not through religion or moral feel , though mani pretend -- perhap fanci -- that this was their reason ; but through the plainest kind of practic sens -- the kind that in the broad determin the action of human be of whatev class , howev lofti the idealist pretens may be . these mother knew that the profess of the pariah meant a short life and a wretch one , meant diseas , lower and ever lower wage , the scale swift descend , meant all the miseri of respect plus a heavi burden of miseri of it own . there were mani other girl besid susan and etta hold up their head -- girl with prospect of matrimoni , girl with fair good wage , girl with father and brother at work and abl to provid a home . but susan and etta were peculiar valuabl as exampl becaus they were make the fight alon and unaid . thus , they were watch close . in those neighborhood everyon know everyon 's els busi down to how the last cent is got and spent . if either girl had appear in a new pair of shoe , a new hat , a new garment of ani kind , at onc the report would have sped that the wearer had taken a turn in the street . and the scandal would have been justifi ; for where could either have respect got the money for the smallest and cheapest addit to her toilet ? matson , too , proud point them out as give the lie to the talk about work girl not get live wage , to the mutter against him and his fellow employ as practic procur for the pavement and the dive , for the chariti hospit 's most dread ward , for the morgu 's most piteous box and slab . as their strength declin , as their miseri ate in and in , the two girl ceas talk togeth ; they use to chatter much of the time like two bird on a leafi , sunni bough . now they walk , ate their scanti , repuls meal , dress , work , all in silenc . when their eye met both glanc guiltili away , each fear the other would discov the thought she was revolv -- the thought of the street . they slept bad -- etta sometim , susan everi night . for a long time after she came to the tenement she had not slept well , despit her youth and the dull toil that wore her out each day . but after mani month she had grown somewhat use to the noisi -- to fret babi , to wail children , the mix ale parti , the quarrel of the ill and the drunk , the incess restless wherev peopl are huddl so close togeth that repos is imposs . and she had gradual acquir the habit of sleep well -- that is , well for the tenement region where no one ever get the rest without which health is imposs . now sleepless came again -- hour on hour of listen to the hate and madden discord of dens crowd human , hour on hour of think -- think -- in the hopeless circl like those of a cage anim , tread with soft swift step round and round , nose to the iron wall , eye gleam with despair pain . one saturday even after a supper of scorch cornmeal which had been none too fresh when they got it at the swindl grocer 's on the street floor , etta put on the tatter , patch old skirt at which she had been toil . `` i ca n't make it fit to wear , '' said she . `` it 's too far gone ; i think '' -- her eyelid flutter -- '' i ll go see some of the girl . '' susan , who was darn -- seat on the one chair -- yes , it had onc been a chair -- did not look up or speak . etta put on her hat -- slowli . then , with a stealthi glanc at susan , she move slide toward the door . as she reach it susan 's hand drop to her lap ; so tens were etta 's nerv that the gestur made her startl . `` etta !

'' susan did not repli . she stare at the remain of a cheap stock in her lap . yes , there was no doubt about it , etta health was go . etta was strong , but she had no such store of strength to draw upon as had accumul for susan dure the seventeen year of simpl , regular life in health surround . a littl while and etta would be ill -- would , perhap -- probabl -- almost certain -- die -- dan cassatt came in at the other door , sat on the edg of his bed and chang his trouser for what he was pleas to imagin a less disreput pair . midway the boy stop and eye susan 's bare leg and foot , a grin of pleasur and amus on his precoci and vicious matur face . `` my , but you keep clean , '' he cri . `` and you ve got a mighti pretti foot . minni 's is ugli as hell . '' minni was the `` fanci ladi '' on the floor below -- '' my skirt , '' he call her . susan evid did not hear his compliment . dan complet his `` sport toilet '' with a sleek down of his long greasi hair , took himself away to his girl . susan was watch a bug crawl down the wall toward their bed with it stain and malodor cover of rag . etta was still stand by the door motionless . she sigh , onc more put her hand on the knob . susan 's voic came again . `` you ve never been out , have you ?

'' `` and you -- out there ! '' `` it doe n't mean much to me . '' etta look at her with eye as devot as a dog 's . `` then we'll go togeth , '' she said . susan , pin on her weather-stain hat , reflect . `` veri well , '' she said final . `` there 's noth lower than this . '' they said no more ; they went out into the clear , cold winter night , out under the brilliant star . sever handsom theater buse were pass on their way from the fashion suburb to the theater . etta look at them , at the splendid hors , at the men in top hat and fur coat -- clean look , fine look , amiabl look men -- at the beauti fur wrap of the delic women -- what complexion ! -- what love hair ! -- what jewel ! etta , her heart burst , her throat choke , glanc at susan to see whether she too was observ . but susan 's eye were on the tenement they had just left . `` what are you look at -- so queer ?

'' `` it take _my_ breath away , too . come on . '' at the foot of the hill they took the shortest rout for vine street , the highway of the citi 's night life . though they were so young and walk brisk , their impoverish blood was not vigor enough to produc a reaction against the sharp wind of the zero night which nose through their few thin garment and bit into their bodi as if they were nake . they came to a vast depart store . each of it great show-window , flood with light , was a fascin display of cloth for women upon wax model -- cost jacket and cloak of wonder fur , white , brown , gray , rich and glossi black ; undercloth fine and soft , with ribbon and flounc and lace ; silk stock and grace shoe and slipper ; dress for street , for ball , for afternoon , dress with form , with line , dress eleg plain , dress rich embroid . despit the cold the two girl linger , go from window to window , their freez face pinch and purpl , their eye gaze hungrili . `` now that we ve tri em all on , '' said susan with a short and bitter laugh , `` let 's dress in our dirti rag again and go .

'' by this time susan and etta had lost all sens of strang . the spirit of adventur was rampant in them as in a dream child . and the life they had been live -- what they had seen and heard and grown accustom to -- made it easi for them to strike out at onc and brisk in the new road , so differ from the dreari and cruel path along which they had been plod . they stood laugh and joke in the parlor while the boy regist ; then the four went up to two small but comfort and fascin clean room with a larg bathroom between . `` fatti and i will go down to the bar while you two dress , '' said john . `` not on your life ! '' exclaim fatti . `` we ll have the bar brought up to us . '' but john , fortifi by susan 's look of gratitud for his tact , whisper to his friend -- what susan could easili guess . and fatti said , `` oh , i never thought of it . yes , we'll give em a chanc . do n't be long , girl . '' `` thank you , '' said susan to john . `` that 's all right . take your time . '' susan lock the hall door behind the two men . she rush to the bathroom , turn on the hot water . `` oh , etta ! '' she cri , tear in her eye , a hyster sob in her throat . `` a bathtub again ! '' etta too was enthusiast ; but she had not that intens hyster joy which susan felt -- a joy that can be appreci onli by a person who , clean by instinct and by lifelong habit , has been shut out from thorough cleanli for long month of dirt and foul odor and cold . it was no easi matter to becom clean again after all those month . but there was plenti of soap and brush and towel , and at last the thing was accomplish . then they tore open the bundl and array themselv in the fresh new undercloth , in the simpl attract costum of jacket , blous and skirt . susan had return to her class , and had brought etta with her . `` what shall we do with these ? '' ask etta , point disdain with the toe of her new boot to the scatter of the garment they had cast off . susan look down at it in horror . she could not believ that _she_ had been wear such stuff -- that it was the cloth of all her associ of the past six month -- was the kind of attir in which most of her fellow-b went about the beauti earth , she shudder . `` is n't life dread ? '' she cri . and she kick togeth the tatter , patch , stain trash , kick it on to a larg piec of heavi wrap paper she had spread out upon the floor . thus , without touch her discard self , she got it wrap up and bound with a strong string . she rang for the maid , gave her a quarter and point to the bundl . `` pleas take that and throw it away , '' she said . when the maid was gone etta said : `` i 'm mighti glad to have it out of the room . '' `` out of the room ? '' cri susan . `` out of my heart . out of my life . '' they put on their hat , admir themselv in the mirror , and descend -- susan rememb halfway that they had left the light on and go back to turn them off . the door boy summon the two young men to the parlor . they enter and exclaim in real amaz . for they were face two extrem pretti young women , one dark , the other fair . the two face were wreath in pleas and grate smile . `` do n't we look nice ? '' demand etta . `` nice ! '' cri fatti . `` we sure did draw a pair of first prize -- did n't we , johnni ? '' john did not repli . he was gaze at susan . etta had young beauti but it was of the commonplac kind . in susan 's face and carriag there was far more than beauti . `` where _did_ you come from ? '' said john to her in an underton . `` and _where_ are you go ? '' `` out to supper , i hope , '' laugh she . `` your eye chang -- do n't they ? i thought they were violet . now i see they re gray -- gray as can be . '' chapter xxii at lunch , well toward the middl of the follow afternoon , fatti -- his proper name was august gulick -- said : `` john and i do n't start for ann arbor until a week from today . that mean seven clear day . a lot can be done in that time , with a littl intellig hustl . what do you say , girl ? do you stick to us ? '' `` as long as you ll let us , '' said etta , who was delight gulick with her frank and wonder and grate appreci of his munific . never befor had his own privat opinion of himself receiv such a flatter sweep indors -- from anyon who happen to impress him as worth while . in the last phrase lie the explan of her success through a polici that is alway danger and usual a failur . so it was settl that with the quiet littl hotel as headquart the four would spend a week in explor cincinnati as a pleasur ground . gulick knew the town thorough . his father was a brewer whose name was on mani a huge beer wagon drawn about those street by showi clydesdal . also he had plenti of money ; and , while redmond -- for his friend was the son of redmond , well known as a lawyer-politician in chicago -- had noth like so much as gulick , still he had enough to make a passabl pretens at keep up his end . for etta and susan the citi had meant shabbi to filthi tenement , toil and weari and sorrow . there was open to their ravish young eye `` the citi '' -- what reveal itself to the pleasure-seek with pocket well fill -- what we usual think of when we pronounc it name , forget what it realiti is for all but a favor few of those within it border . it was a week of music and of laughter -- music especi -- music whenev they ate or drank , music to danc by , music in the beer garden where they spent the earli even , music at the road hous where they arriv in sleigh after the danc to have supper -- unless you choos to call it breakfast . you would have said that susan had slip out of the tenement life as she had out of it garment , that she had retain not a trace of it even in memori . but -- in those day began her habit of never pass a beggar without give someth . within three or four day this life brought a truli amaz transform in the two girl . you would not have recogn in them the pale and wan and rag outcast of onli the saturday night befor . `` are n't you happi ? '' said etta to susan , in one of the few moment they were alon . `` but i do n't need to ask . i did n't know you could be so gay . '' `` i had forgotten how to laugh , '' repli susan . `` i suppos i ought to be asham , '' pursu etta . `` whi ? '' inquir susan . `` oh , you know whi . you know how peopl 'd talk if they knew . '' `` what peopl ? '' said susan . `` anyon who 's will to give you anyth ? '' `` no , '' admit etta . `` but -- -- '' there she halt . susan went on : `` i do n't propos to be bother by the other kind . they would n't do anyth for me if they could except sneer and condemn . '' `` still , you know it is n't right , what we re do . '' `` i know it is n't cold -- or hunger -- or rag and dirt -- and bug , '' repli susan . those few word were enough to conjur even to etta 's duller fanci the whole pictur to it last detail of loathsom squalor . into etta 's face came a daze express . `` was that realli _us_ , lorna ? '' `` no , '' said susan with a certain fierc . `` it was a dream . but we must take care not to have that dream again . '' `` i 'd forgotten how cold i was , '' said etta ; `` had n't you ?

'' `` would fatti like that ? '' etta flush and glanc away . young gulick had soon decid that susan was the stronger -- therefor , the less `` woman '' -- of the two girl , and must be the evil influenc over her whom he had appear just in time to save . when he said this to etta , she protest -- not veri vigor , becaus she wish him to think her realli almost innoc . she was n't _quite_ easi in her mind as to whether she had been loyal to lorna . but , be normal human , she soon _almost_ convinc herself that but for lorna she never would have made the aw ventur . anyhow , sinc it would help her with gulick and would n't do lorna the least mite of harm , whi not let him think he was right ? said susan : `` has n't he been talk to you about get away from -- from all this ?

'' susan laugh , shrug her shoulder . `` i am what i am , '' said she . `` i ca n't be ani differ . if i tri , i 'd onli fail wors . '' `` you do n't love john -- do you ? '' `` i like him . '' `` then you would n't have to do _much_ pretend , '' urg etta . `` and what doe a littl pretend amount to ?

'' etta shook her head in reject of this piec of idealist advic . `` but a girl 's got to be shrewd . you ought to be more so , lorna . '' `` that depend on what a girl want , '' said susan , absent . `` upon what she want , '' she repeat . `` what do _you_ want ? '' inquir etta curious . `` i do n't know , '' susan answer slowli . `` i wish i knew what was go on in your head ! '' exclaim etta . `` so do i , '' said susan , smile . `` do you realli mind my go ? realli -- honest ? '' there was n't a flaw in susan 's look or tone . `` if you tri to stay with me , i 'd run away from you . '' `` and if i do get him , i can help you . onc he 's mine -- -- '' etta round out her sentenc with an express of counten which it was well her ador rescuer did not see . not that it lack womanli ; `` woman '' is the word that most exact describ it -- and alway will exact describ such express -- and the thought behind -- so long as men compel women to be just women , under penalti of refus them support if they are not so . redmond came in , and etta left him alon with susan . `` well , has etta told you ? '' he ask . `` yes , '' repli the girl . she look at him -- simpli a look , but the violet-gray eye had an unusu seem of see into mind and heart , an express that was perhap the more disquiet becaus it was sympathet rather than critic . his glanc shift . he was a notabl handsom young fellow -- too young for ani display of charact in his face , or for ani develop of it beyond the amiabl , free and easi lover of a jolli good time that is the type repeat over and over again among the youth of the comfort class that send their son to colleg . `` are you go with her ?

'' `` i do n't care for prospect besid you . you _are_ a good woman -- insid . the better i know you the less like a fast woman you are . wo n't you go to work , lorna , and wait for me ?

'' `` you think i 'm weak -- do n't you ? '' he said . then , as she did not answer , `` well , i am . but i love you , all the same . '' for the first time he felt that he had touch her heart . the tear sprang to her eye , which were not at all gray now but all violet , as was their wont when she was deepli move . she laid her hand on his shoulder . `` oh , it 's so good to be love ! '' she murmur . he put his arm around her , and for the moment she rest there , content -- yes , content , as mani a woman who need love less and crave it less has been content just with be love , when to make herself content she has had to ignor and forget the person of the man who was do the love -- and the kind of love it was . said he : '' do n't you love me a littl enough to be a good woman and wait till i set up in the law ? '' she let herself play with the idea , to prolong this novel feel of content . she ask , `` how long will that be ? '' `` i ll be admit in two year . i ll soon have a practic . my father 's got influenc . '' susan look at him sad , slowli shook her head . `` two year -- and then sever year more . and i work in a factori -- or behind a counter -- from dawn till after dark -- poor , hungri -- half-nak -- wear my heart out -- wear my bodi away -- -- '' she drew away from him , laugh . `` i was fool , john -- about marri . i like to hear you say those thing . i could n't marri you if i would . i 'm marri alreadi . '' `` _you_ ! '' she nod . `` tell me about it -- wo n't you ? '' she look at him in astonish , so amaz seem the idea that she could tell anyon that experi . it would be like voluntarili show a hideous , repuls scar or wound , for sometim it was scar , and sometim open wound , and alway the thing that made whatev befel her endur by comparison . she did not answer his appeal for her confid but went on , '' anyhow , noth could induc me to go to work again . you don't realiz what work mean -- the onli sort of work i can get to do . it 's -- it 's sell both bodi and soul . i prefer -- -- '' he kiss her to stop her from finish her sentenc . `` do n't -- pleas , '' he plead . `` you do n't understand . in this life you ll soon grow hard and coars and lose your beauti and your health -- and becom a moral and physic wreck . '' she reflect , the grave express in her eye -- the express that gave whoever saw it the feel of dread as befor impend tragedi . `` yes -- i suppos so , '' she said . `` but -- -- ani sooner than as a work girl live in a dirti hole in a tenement ? no -- not so soon . and in this life i ve got a chanc if i 'm care of my health and -- and do n't let thing touch _me_ . in that other -- there 's no chanc -- none ! '' `` what chanc have you got in this life ? '' `` i do n't know exact . i 'm veri ignor yet . at worst , it simpli that i ve got no chanc in either life -- and this life is more comfort . '' `` comfort ! with men you do n't like -- fright men -- -- '' '' were you ever cold ? '' ask susan . but it made no impress upon him who had no concept of the cold that know not how it is ever to get warm again . he rush on : '' lorna , my god ! '' he caught hold of her and strain her to his breast . `` you are love and sweet ! it 's fright -- you in this life . '' her express made the sob choke up into his throat . she said quiet : `` not wors than dirt and vermin and freez cold and long , long , dull -- oh , _so_ dull hour of work among human be that do n't ever wash -- becaus they ca n't . '' she push him gentl away . `` you do n't understand . you have n't been through it . comfort peopl talk like fool about those thing . . . . do you rememb my hand that first even ? '' he redden and his eye shift . `` i 'm absurd sensit about a woman 's hand , '' he mutter . she laugh at him . `` oh , i saw -- how you could n't bear to look at them -- how they made you shiver . well , the hand were noth -- _nothing_ ! -- besid what you did n't see . '' `` lorna , do you love someon els ? '' his eye demand an honest answer , and it seem to her his feel for her deserv it . but she could not put the answer into word . she lower her gaze . `` then whi -- -- '' he began impetu . but there he halt , for he knew she would not lift the veil over herself , over her past . `` i 'm veri , veri fond of you , '' she said with depress friendli . then with a sweet laugh , `` you ought to be glad i'm not abl to take you at your word . and you will be glad soon . '' she sigh . `` what a good time we ve had ! '' `` if i onli had a decent allow , like fatti ! '' he groan . `` no use talk about that . it 's best for us to separ best for us both . you ve been good to me -- you ll never know how good . and i ca n't play you a mean trick . i wish i could be selfish enough to do it , but i ca n't . '' `` you do n't love me . that 's the reason . '' `` mayb it is . yes , i guess that 's whi i ve got the courag to be squar with you . anyhow , john , you ca n't afford to care for me . and if i care for you , and put off the part -- whi it 'd onli put off what i ve got to go through with befor -- -- '' she did not finish ; her eye becam dreami . `` befor what ? '' he ask . `` i do n't know , '' she said , return with a sigh . `` someth i see -- yet do n't see in the dark , ahead of me . '' `` i ca n't make you out , '' cri he . her express move him to the same awe she inspir in etta -- a feel that gave both of them the sens of have known her better , of have been more intim with her when they first met her than they ever had been sinc or ever would be again . when redmond embrac and kiss her for the last time , he was in anoth and less sympathet mood , was busi with his own wound to vaniti and perhap to heart . he thought her heartless -- good and sweet and friend , but without sentiment . she refus to help him make a scene ; she refus to say she would write to him , and ask him not to write to her . `` you know we ll probabl see each other soon . '' `` not till the long vacat -- not till near juli . '' `` onli three month . '' `` oh , if you look at it that way ! '' said he , piqu and sullen . girl had alway been more than kind , more than eager , when he had shown interest . etta , leav on a later train , was even more depress about susan 's heart . she wept hyster , wish susan to do the same ; but susan stood out firm against a scene , and would not have it that etta was shame desert her , as etta tear accus herself . `` you re go to be happi , '' she said . `` and i 'm not so selfish as to be wretch about it . and do n't you worri a minut on my account . i 'm better off in everi way than i ve ever been . i ll get on all right . '' `` i know you gave up john to help me with august . i know you mean to break off everyth . oh , lorna , you must n't -- you must n't . '' `` do n't talk nonsens , '' was susan 's unsatisfactori repli . when it came down to the last embrac and the last kiss , etta did feel through susan 's lip and close encircl arm a someth that dri up her hyster tear and fill her heart with an aw ach . it did not last long . no matter how wild shallow water are stir , they soon calm and murmur placid on again . the three who had left her would have been amaz could they have seen her a few minut after etta 's train roll out of the union station . the differ between strong natur and weak is not that the strong are free from cowardic and faint-hearted , from doubt and forebod , from love and affect , but that they do not stay down when they are crush down , stagger up and on . susan hurri to the room they had help her find the day befor -- a room in a hous where no question were ask or answer . she lock herself in and gave way to the agoni of her loneli . and when her grief had exhaust her , she lay upon the bed stare at the wall with eye that look as though her soul had empti itself through them of all that make life endur , even of hope . for the first time in her life she thought of suicid -- not suicid the vagu possibl , not suicid the remot way of escap , but suicid the close and intim friend , the healer of all woe , the solac of all grief -- suicid , the speedi , accur solver of the worst problem destini can put to man . she saw her pocketbook on the floor where she had drop it . `` i ll wait till my money 's gone , '' thought she . then she rememb etta -- how gentl and love she was , how utter she gave herself -- for susan was still far from the profound knowledg of charact that enabl us to disregard outward sign in measur actual . `` if i realli were n't harder than etta , '' her thought ran on reproach , `` i 'd not wait until the money went . i 'd kill myself now , and have it over with . '' the truth was that if the posit of the two girl had been revers and susan had love gulick as intens as etta profess and believ she love him , still susan would have given him up rather than have left etta alon . and she would have done it without ani sens of sacrific . and it must be admit that , whether or not there are those who deserv credit for do right , certain those who do right simpli becaus they can not do otherwis -- the onli trustworthi peopl -- deserv no credit for it . she count her money -- twenty-thre dollar in bill , and some chang . redmond had given her fifti dollar each time they had gone shop , and had made her keep the balanc -- his indirect way of adjust the financi side . twenty-thre dollar meant perhap two week ' live . well , she would live those two week decent and comfort and then -- bid life adieu unless someth turn up -- for back to the street she would not go . with etta gone , with not a friend anywher on earth , life was not worth the price she had paid for etta and herself to the drunken man . her streak of good fortun in meet redmond had given her no illus ; from mabel connemora , from what she herself had heard and seen -- and experienc -- she knew the street woman 's life , and she could not live that life for herself alon . she could talk about it to redmond tranquilli . she could think about it in the abstract , could see how other women did it , and how those who had intellig might well surviv and lift themselv up in it . but do it she could not . so she resolv upon suicid , firm believ in her own resolv . and she was not one to deceiv herself or to shrink from anyth whatsoev . except the insan , onli the young make these resolv and act upon them ; for the young have not yet learn to valu life , have not yet fallen under life 's sinist spell that make human be cling more firm and more craven to it as they grow older . the young must have someth -- some hope , howev fanat and fals -- to live for . they will not tarri just to live . and in that hour susan had lost hope . she took off her street dress and open her trunk to get a wrapper and bedroom slipper . as she lift the lid , she saw an envelop address `` lorna '' ; she rememb that redmond had lock and strap the trunk . she tore the end from the envelop , look in . some fold bill ; noth more . she sat on the floor and count two twenti , five ten , two five -- a hundr dollar ! she look daze at the money -- gave a cri of delight -- sprang to her feet , with a chang like the startl shift from night to day in the tropic . `` i can pay ! '' she cri . `` i can pay ! '' bubbl over with smile and with littl laugh , gay as even champagn and the releas from the vile prison of the slum had made her , she with eager hand took from the trunk her best cloth -- the jacket and skirt of dark gray check she had bought for thirti dollar at shillito 's and had had alter to her figur and her tast ; the blous of good qualiti linen with rather a fanci collar ; the gray leather belt with a big oxid silver buckl ; her onli pair of silk stock ; the pair of high-heel patent leather shoe -- the larg black hat with a gray feather curl attract round and over it brim . the hat had cost onli fourteen dollar becaus she had put it togeth herself ; if she had bought it made , she would have paid not less than thirti dollar . all these thing she care unpack and care laid out . then she thorough brush her hair and did it up in a grace pompadour that would go well with the hat . she wash away the trace of her outburst of grief , went over her finger nail , now almost recov from the disast incid to the life of manual labor . she went on to complet her toilet , all with the same attent to detail -- a sure indic , in one so young , of a desir to pleas some specif person . when she had the hat set at the satisfactori angl and the veil wound upon it and drape over her fresh young face coquettish , she took from her slender store of glove a fresh gray pair and , as she put them on , stood befor the glass examin herself . there was now not a trace of the tenement work girl of a week and a day befor . here was beauti in bloom , fresh and allur from head to narrow , well-boot feet . more than a hint of a fine color sens -- that vital qualiti , if fashion , the convent , is to be refin and individu into style , the rare -- more than a hint of color sens show in the harmoni of the pearl gray in the big feather , the pearl gray in the collar of the blous , and the pearl white of her skin . susan had inde return to her own class . she had left it , a small-town girl with more than a suggest of the child in eye and mouth ; she had return to it , a young woman of the citi , with that look in her face which onli experi can give -- experi that has result in growth . she lock all her possess away in her trunk -- all but her money ; that she put in her stock -- seventy-f dollar well down in the right leg , the rest of the bill well down in the left leg ; the two dollar or so in chang was all she intrust to the pocketbook she carri . she cast a coquettish glanc down at her charm array feet -- a harmless glanc of coquetri that will be condemn by those whose physic vaniti happen to center elsewher . after this glanc she drop her skirt -- and was readi . by this time dusk had fallen , and it was near six o'clock . as she came out of the hous she glanc toward the west -- the instinct gestur of peopl who live in raini climat . her face brighten ; she saw an omen in the long broad streak of redden even sky . chapter xxiii she went down to fourth street , along it to race , to the _commercial_ build . at the entranc to the corridor at the far side of which were elev and stairway , she paus and consid . she turn into the busi offic . `` is mr. roderick spenser here ?

'' he drop into silenc , puzzl and in a way awe by the mysteri envelop her -- a mysteri of aloof and stoni , of complet separ from the contact of the world -- the mysteri that inclos all whose real life is live deep within themselv . chapter xxiv like day later , on the eastern express , they were not so confid as they had been over the st. nichola champagn . as confid about the remot futur , it was that annoy littl stretch near at hand which gave them secret uneasi . there had been noth but dream and sentiment in those four day -- and that disquiet suggest the soldier who with an impress flourish high resolv to give battl , then sheath his sword and goe away to a revel . also , like all idler , they had spent money -- far more money than total net cash resourc of less than five hundr dollar warrant . `` we ve spent an aw lot of money , '' said susan . she was quick to see the faint frown , the warn that she was on danger ground . said he : '' do you regret ? '' `` no , inde -- no !

'' she had no disposit to inquir curious into this . her repli was a flash of a smile that was like a flash of glorious light upon the crest of a wave surg straight from her happi heart . they were opposit each other at breakfast in the restaur car . he delight in her frank delight in the novelti of travel -- swift and luxuri travel . he had never been east befor , himself , but he had had experi of sleeper and diner ; she had not , and everi moment she was get some new sensat . she especi enjoy this sit at breakfast with the express train rush smooth along through the mountain -- the first mountain either had seen . at time they were so intens happi that they laugh with tear in their eye and touch hand across the tabl to get from physic contact the reassur of realiti . `` how good to eat everyth is ! '' she exclaim . `` you ll think me veri greedi , i 'm afraid . but if you 'd eaten the stuff i have sinc we dine on the rock ! '' they were alway go back to the rock , and neither weari of recal and remind each other of the smallest detail . it seem to them that everyth , even the least happen , at that sacr spot must be rememb , must be record indel in the book of their romanc . `` i 'm glad we were happi togeth in such circumst , '' she went on . `` it was a test -- was n't it , rod ? '' `` if two peopl do n't love each other enough to be happi anywher , they could be happi nowher , '' declar he . `` so , we ll not mind be veri , veri care about spend money in new york , '' she ventur -- for she was again bring up the subject she had been privat revolv ever sinc they had form the partnership . in her wander with burlingham , in her sojourn in the tenement , she had learn a great deal about the care and spend of money -- had develop that instinct for forehanded which natur has implant in all normal women along with the matern instinct -- and as a necessari supplement to it . this instinct is more or less futil in most women becaus they are more or less ignor of the realiti as to wise and foolish expenditur . but it is found in the most extravag women no less than in the most absurd and mean stingi . `` of cours , we must be care , '' assent rod . `` but i ca n't let you be uncomfort . '' `` now , dear , '' she remonstr , `` you must n't treat me that way . i 'm better fit for hardship than you . i 'd mind it less . '' he laugh ; she look so fine and delic , with her transpar skin and her curv of figur , he felt that anyth so near perfect could not but easili be spoil . and there he show how littl he appreci her iron strength , her almost exhaustless endur . he fanci he was the stronger becaus he could have crush her in his muscular arm . but exposur , privat , dissip that would have done for a muscular stronger man than he would have left no trace upon her after a few day of rest and sleep . `` it 's the truth , '' she insist . `` i could prove it , but i sha n't . i do n't want to rememb vivid . rod , we _must_ live cheapli in new york until you sell a play and i have a place in some compani . '' `` yes , '' he conced . `` but , susi , not too cheap . a cheap way of live make a cheap man -- give a man a cheap outlook on life . besid , do n't forget -- if the worst come to the worst , i can alway get a job on a newspap . '' she would not have let him see how uneasi this remark made her . howev , she could not permit it to pass without notic . said she a littl nervous : '' but you ve made up your mind to devot yourself to play -- to stand or fall by that . '' he rememb how he had thrill her and himself with brave talk about the necess of concentr , of select a goal and move relentless for it , let noth halt him or turn him asid . for his year rod spenser was as wise in the philosophi of success as burlingham or tom brashear . but he had done that brave and wise talk befor he love her as he now did -- befor he realiz how love can be in itself an achiev and a possess so great that other ambit dwarf besid it . true , away back in his facil , fickl mind , behind the region where self-excus and somebody-else-always-to-blam reign suprem , a someth -- the someth that had set the mark of success so strong upon his face -- was whisper to him the real reason for his now revolv a new york newspap job . real reason as distinguish from alleg reason and imagin reason , from the reason self-decept invent and vaniti give out -- real reason are alway interest and worth note . what was rod 's ? not his love for her ; noth so superior , so superhuman as that . no , it was weak and wobbl misgiv as to his own abil to get on independ , the misgiv that menac everi man who has never work for himself but has alway drawn pay -- the misgiv that paralyz most men and keep them wage or salari slave all their live . rod was no better pleas at this sli , unwelcom revel of his real self to himself than the next human be is in similar circumst . the whisper was hastili suppress ; love for her , desir that she should be comfort -- those must be the real reason . but he must be care lest she , the sensit , should begin to brood over a fear that she was alreadi weaken him and would becom a drag upon him -- the fear that , he knew , would take shape in his own mind if thing began to go bad . `` you may be sure , dearest , '' he said , `` i ll do noth that wo n't help me on .

'' in the even 's gather dusk the train steam into jersey citi ; and spenser and susan lenox , with the adventur mingl hope and dread , confid and doubt , courag and fear , follow the crowd down the long platform under the vast train shed , went through the huge throng waiting-room and aboard the giant ferryboat which fill both with astonish becaus of it size and luxuri . `` i am a jay ! '' said she . `` i can hard keep my mouth from drop open . '' `` you have n't ani the advantag of me , '' he assur her . `` are you trembl all over ? '' `` yes , '' she admit . `` and my heart 's like lead . i suppos there are thousand on thousand like us , from all over the countri -- who come here everi day -- feel as we do . '' `` let 's go out on the front deck -- where we can see it . '' they went out on the upper front deck and , lean against the forward gate , with their travel bag at their feet , they stood dumb befor the most astound and most splendid scene in the civil world . it was not quit dark yet ; the air was almost juli hot , as one of those prematur warm day new york so often has in march . the sky , a soft and delic blue shade into opal and crimson behind them , display a bright crescent moon as it arch over the fairyland in the dusk befor them . straight ahead , across the broad , swift , sparkl river -- the broadest water susan had ever seen -- rose the mighti , the majest citi . it rose direct from the water . endless stretch of ethereal-look structur , reach higher and higher , in mass like mountain rang , in peak , in tower and dome . and million of light , like fairi lamp , like resplend jewel , gave the citi a glori beyond that of the star throng the heaven on a clear summer night . they look toward the north ; on and on , to the far horizon edg stretch the broad river and the love citi that seem the newborn offspr of the wave ; on and on , the myriad light , in mass , in festoon , in great gleam globe of fire from tower rise higher than susan 's and rod 's nativ hill . they look to the south . there , too , rose citi , mile after mile , and then beyond it the expans of the bay ; and everywher the light , the beauti , soft , starlik light , shed a radianc as of heaven itself over the whole scene . majesti and strength and beauti . `` i love it ! '' murmur the girl . `` alreadi i love it . '' `` i never dream it was like this , '' said roderick , in an awe tone . `` the citi of the star , '' said she , in the caress tone in which a lover speak the name of the belov . they move closer togeth and clasp hand and gaze as if they fear the whole thing -- river and magic citi and their own selv -- would fade away and vanish forev . susan clutch rod in terror as she saw the vision sudden begin to move , to advanc toward her , like apparit in a dream befor they vanish . then she exclaim , `` whi , we are move ! '' the big ferryboat , swift , steadi as land , noiseless , had got under way . upon them from the direct of the distant and hidden sea blew a cool , fresh breez . never befor had either smell that perfum , strong and keen and clean , which come straight from the unbreath air of the ocean to bath new york , to put life and hope and health into it peopl . rod and susan turn their face southward toward this breez , drank in great draught of it . they saw a coloss statu , vivid as life in the dusk , in the hand at the end of the high-flung arm a torch which sent a blaze of light stream out over land and water . `` that must be liberti , '' said roderick . susan slip her arm through his . she was quiver with excit and joy . `` rod -- rod ! '' she murmur . `` it 's the isl of freedom . kiss me . '' and he bent and kiss her , and his cheek felt the tear upon her . he reach for her hand , with an instinct to strengthen her . but when he had it within his it firm and vital grasp sent a thrill of strength through him . a few minut , and they paus at the exit from the ferri hous . they almost shrank back , so daze and helpless did they feel befor the stagger billow of nois that swept savag down upon them -- roar and crash , shriek and snort ; the air was shudder with it , the ground quak . the beauti had vanish -- the beauti that was not the citi but a glamour to lure them into the citi 's grasp ; now that citi stood reveal as a monster about to seiz and devour them . `` god ! '' he shout in her ear . `` is n't this _fright ! _ '' she was recov more quick than he . the face she saw reassur her . they were human face ; and while they were eager and restless , as if the soul behind them sought that which never could be found , they were sane and kind face , too . where other of her own race live , and live without fear , she , too , could hope to surviv . and alreadi she , who had love this mighti offspr of the sea and the sky at first glanc , saw and felt anoth magic -- the magic of the peopl solitud . in this vast , this endless solitud she and he would be free . they could do as they pleas , live as they pleas , without thought of the opinion of other . here she could forget the bestial horror of marriag ; here she would fear no scorn point at her birth-brand of shame . she and rod could be poor without shame ; they could make their fight in the grate dark of obscur . `` scare ? '' he ask . `` not a bit , '' was her prompt answer . `` i love it more than ever . '' `` well , it frighten me a littl . i feel helpless -- lost in the nois and the crowd . how can i do anyth here ! '' `` other have . other do . '' `` yes -- yes ! that 's so . we must take hold ! '' and he select a cabman from the shout swarm . `` we want to go , with two trunk , to the hotel st. deni , '' said he . `` all right , sir ! gim me the check , pleas . '' spenser was about to hand them over when susan said in an underton , `` you have n't ask the price . '' spenser hasten to repair this import omiss . `` ten dollar , '' repli the cabman as if ten dollar were some such trifl as ten cent . spenser laugh at the first experi of the famous new york habit of talk in a faint careless way of larg sum of money -- other peopl 's money . `` you did save us a swat , '' he said to susan , and beckon anoth man . the upshot of a long and arduous discuss , noisi and profan , was that they got the carriag for six dollar -- a price which the policeman who had been drawn into the discuss vouch for as reason . spenser knew it was too high , knew the policeman would get a dollar or so of the profit , but he was weari of the wrangl ; and he would not listen to susan 's suggest that they have the trunk sent by the express compani and themselv go in a street car for ten cent . at the hotel they got a larg comfort room and a bath for four dollar a day . spenser insist it was cheap ; susan show her alarm -- less than an hour in new york and ten dollar gone , not to speak of she did not know how much chang . for roderick had been scatter tip with what is for some mysteri reason call `` a princ hand , '' though princ know too well the valu of money and have too mani extravag tast ever to go far in sheer throw away . they had dinner in the restaur of the hotel and set out to explor the land they purpos to subdu and to possess . they walk up broadway to fourteenth , miss their way in the dazzl and glare of south union squar , discov the wander highway again after some search . after the long , rather quiet stretch between union squar and thirty-fourth street they found themselv at the veri heart of the citi 's night life . they gaze in wonder upon the elev road with it train thunder by high abov them . they cross greeley squar and stood entranc befor the spectacl -- a street bright as day with electr sign of everi color , shape and size ; sidewalk jam with peopl , most of them dress with as much pretens to fashion as the few best in cincinnati ; one theater after anoth , and at forty-second street theater in everi direct . sure -- sure -- there would be small difficulti in place his play when there were so mani theater , all eager for play . they debat go to the theater , decid against it , as they were tire from the journey and the excit of crowd new sensat . `` i ve never been to a real theater in my life , '' said susan . `` i want to be fresh the first time i go . '' `` yes , '' cri rod . `` that 's right . tomorrow night . that _will_ be an experi ! '' and they read the illumin sign , inspect the show window , and slowli stroll back toward the hotel . as they were recross union squar , spenser said , `` have you notic how mani street girl there are ? we must have pass a thousand . is n't it fright ? '' `` yes , '' said susan . rod made a gestur of disgust , and said with feel , `` how low a woman must have sunk befor she could take to that life ! '' `` yes , '' said susan . `` so low that there could n't possibl be left ani shred of feel or decenc anywher in her . '' susan did not repli . `` it 's not a question of moral , but of sensibl , '' pursu he . `` some day i 'm go to write a play or a stori about it . a woman with anyth to her , who had to choos between that life and death , would n't hesit an instant . she could n't . a streetwalk ! '' and again he made that gestur of disgust . `` befor you write , '' said susan , in a queer , quiet voic , `` you'll find out all about it . mayb some of these girl -- most of them -- all of them -- are still human be . it 's not fair to judg peopl unless you know . and it 's so easi to say that someon els ought to die rather than do this or that . '' `` you ca n't imagin yourself do such a thing , '' urg he . susan hesit , then -- '' yes , '' she said . her tone irrit him . `` oh , nonsens ! you do n't know what you re talk about . '' `` yes , '' said susan . `` susi ! '' he exclaim , look reprov at her . she met his eye without flinch . `` yes , '' she said . `` i have . '' he stop short and his express set her bosom to heav . but her gaze was steadi upon his . `` whi did you tell me ! '' he cri . `` oh , it is n't so -- it ca n't be . you do n't mean exact that . '' `` yes , i do , '' said she . `` do n't tell me ! i do n't want to know .

'' `` now i ll alway think of it -- whenev i look at you . . . . i simpli ca n't believ it . . . . you spoke of it as if you were n't asham . '' `` i 'm not asham , '' she said . `` not befor you . there isn't anyth i ve done that i would n't be will to have you know . i 'd have told you , except that i did n't want to recal it . you know that nobodi can live without get dirti . the thing is to want to be clean -- and to tri to get clean afterward -- is n't it ? '' `` yes , '' he admit , as if he had not been hear . `` i wish you had n't told me . i ll alway see it and feel it when i look at you . '' `` i want you to , '' said she . `` i could n't love you as i do if i had n't gone through a great deal . '' `` but it must have left it stain upon you , '' said he . again he stop short in the street , face her at the curb , with the crowd hurri by and jostl them . `` tell me about it ! '' he command . she shook her head . `` i could n't . '' to have told would have been like tear open close and heal wound . also it would have seem whine -- and she had utter contempt for whine . `` i'll answer ani question , but i ca n't just go on and tell . '' `` you deliber went and did -- that ? '' `` yes . '' `` have n't you ani excus , ani defens ? '' she might have told him about burlingham die and the need of money to save him . she might have told him about etta -- her health go -- her mind made up to take to the street , with no one to look after her . she might have made it all a move and a true tale -- of self-sacrific for the two peopl who had done most for her . but it was not in her simpl honest natur to tri to shift blame . so all she said was : '' no , rod . '' `` and you did n't want to kill yourself first ?

'' she walk besid him , make no attempt to break his gloomi silenc . they went up to their room and she sat on the loung by the window . he lit a cigarett and half sat , half lay , upon the bed . after a long time he said with a bitter laugh , `` and i was so sure you were a good woman ! '' `` i do n't feel bad , '' she ventur timid . `` am i ? '' `` do you mean to tell me , '' he cri , sit up , `` that you don't think anyth of those thing ?

'' `` no , '' said she . `` i do n't . . . . i 'm sorri you did n't understand . i thought you did -- not the detail , but in a general sort of way . i did n't mean to deceiv you . that would have seem to me much wors than anyth i did . '' `` i might have known ! i might have known ! '' he cri -- rather theatric , though sincer withal -- for mr. spenser was a dilig worker with the tool of the play-mak trade . `` i learn who you were as soon as i got home the night i left you in carrolton . they had been telephon about you to the villag . so i knew about you . '' `` about my mother ? '' ask she . `` is that what you mean ? '' `` oh , you need not look so asham , '' said he , gracious , piti . `` i am not asham , '' said she . but she did not tell him that her look came from an aw fear that he was about to make her asham of him . `` no , i suppos you are n't , '' he went on , incens by this further evid of her lack of a good woman 's instinct . `` i realli ought not to blame you . you were born wrong -- born with the moral sens left out .

'' `` i do n't mind . i did n't expect that . we can _love_ -- ca n't we ?

'' susan had never been in a real theater . the onli approach to a playhous in sutherland was mason hall . it had a sort of stage at one end where from time to time wander player gave poor perform of poor play or a minstrel show or a low vaudevill . but none of the best peopl of sutherland went -- at least , none of the women . the notion was strong in sutherland that the theater was of the devil -- not so strong as in the day befor they began to toler amateur theatric , but still vigor enough to give susan now , as she sat in the big , brilliant auditorium , a pleas sens that she , an outcast , was at last comfort at home . usual the first sight of anyth one has dream about is piti disappoint . neither natur nor life can build so splendid as a vivid fanci . but susan , in some sort prepar for the shortcom of the stage , was not disappoint . from rise to fall of curtain she was so fascin , so absolut absorb , that she quit forgot her surround , even rod . and between the act she could not talk for think . rod , deceiv by her silenc , was chagrin . he had been look forward to a great happi for himself in see her happi , and much profit from the studi of the viewpoint of an absolut fresh mind . it was n't until they were leav the theater that he got an inkl of the true state of affair with her . `` let 's go to supper , '' said he . `` if you do n't mind , '' repli she , `` i 'd rather go home . i 'm veri tire . '' `` you were sound asleep this morn . so you must have slept well , '' said he sarcast . `` it 's the play , '' said she . `` _why_ did n't you like it ? '' he ask , irrit . she look at him in wonder . `` like what ? the play ? '' she drew a long breath . `` i feel as if it had almost kill me . '' he understood when they were in their room and she could hard undress befor fall into a sleep so relax , so profound , that it made him a littl uneasi . it seem to him the exhaust of a child worn out with the excit of a spectacl . and her failur to go into ecstasi the next day led him further into the same error . `` modjeska is veri good as _magda_ , '' said he , careless , as one talk without expect to be understood . `` but they say there 's an italian woman -- duse -- who is the real thing . '' modjeska -- duse -- susan seem inde not to understand . `` i hate her father , '' she said . `` he did n't deserv to have such a wonder daughter . '' spenser had begun to laugh with her first sentenc . at the second he frown , said bitter : `` i might have known ! you get it all wrong . i suppos you sympath with _magda_ ? '' `` i worship her , '' said susan , her voic low and tremul with the intens of her feel . roderick laugh bitter . `` natur , '' he said . `` you can't understand . '' an obvious case , thought he . she was inde one of those instanc of absolut lack of moral sens . just as some peopl have the misfortun to be born without arm or without leg , so other are doom to live bereft of a moral sens . a sweet disposit , a beauti bodi , but no soul ; not a stain soul , but no soul at all . and his whole mental attitud toward her chang ; or , rather , it was chang by the iron compuls of his prejudic . the onli chang in his physic attitud -- that is , in his treatment of her -- was in the direct of bolder passion . of complet cast asid of all the restraint a convent respect of convent womanhood feel toward a woman whom he respect . so , natur , susan , eager to love and to be love , and easili confus the not easili distinguish spiritu and physic , was reassur . onc in a while a look or a phrase from him gave her vagu uneasi ; but on the whole she felt that , in addit to clear conscienc from straightforward , she had a further reason for be glad chanc had forc upon her the altern of tell him or lie . she did not inquir into the realiti beneath the surfac of their life -- neither into what he thought of her , nor into what she thought of him -- thought in the bottom of her heart . she continu to fight against , to ignor , her feel of alon , her feel of impend departur . she was aid in this by her anxieti about their financ . in his effort to place his play he was spend what were for them larg sum of money -- treat this man and that to dinner , to supper -- invit men to lunch with him at expens broadway restaur . she assum that all this was necessari ; he said so , and he must know . he was equal open-hand when they were alon , insist on order the more expens dish , on have supper they realli did not need and drink which she knew she would be better off without -- and , she suspect , he also . it simpli was not in him , she saw , to be care about money . she like it , as a trait , for to her as to all the young and the unthink careless about money seem a sure , perhap the surest , sign of generos -- when in fact the two qualiti are in no way relat . charact is not a collect of ignor impuls but a solid woven fabric of deliber purpos . careless about anyth most often indic a tendenc to careless about everyth . she admir his openhand way of scatter ; she would n't have admir it in herself , would have thought it dishonest and selfish . but rod was differ . _he_ had the `` artist tempera , '' while she was a commonplac nobodi , who ought to be -- and was -- grate to him for allow her to stay on and for make such use of her as he saw fit . still , even as she admir , she saw danger , grave danger , a disturb short distanc ahead . he describ to her the difficulti he was have in get to manag , in have his play read , and the absurd of the reason given for turn it down . he made light of all these ; the next manag would see , would give him a big advanc , would put the play on -- and then , easi street ! but experi had alreadi kill what littl optim there was in her tempera -- and there had not been much , becaus georg warham was a success man in his line , and success men do not creat or permit optimist atmospher even in their hous . nor had she forgotten burlingham 's lectur on the subject with illustr from his own spoil career ; she understood it all now -- and everyth els he had given her to store up in her memori that retain everyth . with that philipp against optim in mind , she felt what spenser was rush toward . she made such inquiri about work for herself as her inexperi and limit opportun permit . she ask , she beg him , to let her tri to get a place . he angrili order her to put ani such notion out of her head . after a time she nerv herself again to speak . then he frank show her whi he was refus . `` no , '' said he peremptorili , `` i could n't trust you in those temptat . you must stay where i can guard you .

'' when they were at the tabl at rector 's and he had taken a few more drink , he becam volubl and plausibl on the subject of the trifl import of his setback as a playwright . it was the worst possibl time of year ; the manag were stock up ; his play would have to be rewritten to suit some particular star ; a place on a newspap , especi such an influenti paper as the _herald_ , would be of use to him in interest manag . she listen and look convinc , and strove to convinc herself that she believ . but there was no gray in her eye , onli the deepest hue of violet . next day they took a suit of two room and a bath in a pretenti old hous in west forty-fourth street near long acr squar . she insist that she prefer anoth much sunnier and quieter suit with no bath but onli a stationari washstand ; it was to be had for ten dollar a week . but he laugh at her as too econom in her idea , and decid for the eighteen-dollar room . also he went with her to buy cloth , made her spend near a hundr dollar where she would have spent less than twenty-f . `` i prefer to make most of my thing , '' declar she . `` and i ve all the time in the world .

'' he ask . `` noth -- noth , '' she repli . chapter xxv at the hotel they had been mr. and mrs. spenser . when they move , he tri to devis some way round this ; but it was necessari that they have his address at the offic , and mrs. pershal with the glisten old-fashion fals teeth who kept the furnished-room hous was not one in whose wither bosom it would be wise to rais a suspicion as to respect . onli in a strenuous respect hous would he live ; in the other sort , what might not untrustworthi susan be up to ? so mr. and mrs. spenser they remain , and the truth was suspect by onli a few of their acquaint , was known by two or three of his intim whom he told in those burst of confid to which volubl , careless men are given -- and for which they in resolut self-excus unjust blame strong drink . one of his favorit remark to her -- sometim made laugh , again iron , again angrili , again insult , was in this strain : '' your face is demur enough . but you look too damn attract about those beauti feet of your to be respect at heart -- and trustabl . '' that matter of her untrustworthi had becom a fix idea with him . the more he concentr upon her physic loveli , the more he revolv the danger , the possibl of unfaith ; for a physic infatu is alway jealous . his work on the _herald_ made close guard out of the question . the best he could do was to pop in unexpect upon her from time to time , to rummag through her belong , to check up her statement as to her go and come by question the servant and , most import of all , each day to put her through search and skill plan cross-examin . she had to tell him everyth she did -- everi littl thing -- and he calcul the time , to make sure she had not found half an hour or so in which to deceiv him . if she had sew , he must look at the sew ; if she had read , he must know how mani page and must hear a summari of what those page contain . as she would not and could not deceiv him in ani matter , howev small , she was compel to give over a plan quiet to look for work and to fit herself for some occup that would pay a live wage -- if there were such for a begin woman worker . at first he was covert in this detect work , be asham of his own suspicion . but as he drank , as he associ again with the same sort of peopl who had wast his time in cincinnati , he rapid becam franker and more inquisitori . and she dread to see the look she knew would come into his eye , the cruel tighten of his mouth , if in her confus and eager she should happen not instant to satisfi the doubt behind each question . he torment her ; he torment himself . she suffer from humili ; but she suffer more becaus she saw how his suspicion were tortur him . and in her humil and helpless and inexperi , she felt no sens of right to resist , no impuls to resist . and she forc herself to look on his spasm of jealousi as the occasion storm which occur even in the best climat . she remind herself that she was secur of his love , secur in his love ; and in her sad mood she reproach herself for not be content when at bottom everyth was all right . after what she had been through , to be sad becaus the man she love love her too well ! it was absurd , ungrat . he pri into everi nook and corner of her be with that ingeni and tireless persist human be reserv for search for what they do not wish to find . at last he contriv to find , or to imagin he had found , someth that justifi his labor and vindic his disbelief in her . they were walk in fifth avenu one afternoon , at the hour when there is the greatest press of equipag whose expens and showili dress occup are industri engag in the occup of imagin they are do someth when in fact they are do noth . what a world ! what a grotesqu confus of motion and progress ! what fantast delus that one is busi when one is mere occupi ! they were between forty-sixth street and forty-seventh , on the west side , when a small victoria drew up at the curb and a woman descend and cross the sidewalk befor them to look at the display in a millin window . susan gave her the swift , see glanc which one woman alway give anoth -- the glanc of competitor at each other offer . instead of glanc away , susan stop short and gaze . forget rod , she herself went up to the millineri display that she might have a fuller view of the woman who had fascin her . `` what 's the matter ? '' cri spenser . `` come on . you do n't want ani of those hat . '' but susan insist that she must see , made him linger until the woman return to her carriag and drove away . she said to rod : '' did you see her ? '' `` yes . rather pretti -- noth to scream about . '' `` but her _style ! _ '' cri susan . `` oh , she was nice dress -- in a quiet way . you ll see thousand a lot more excit after you ve been about in this town a while . '' `` i ve seen score of beauti dress women here -- and in cincinnati , too , '' repli susan . `` but that woman -- she was _perfect_ . and that 's a thing i ve never seen befor . '' `` i 'm glad you have such quiet tast -- quiet and inexpens . '' `` inexpens ! '' exclaim susan . `` i do n't dare think how much that woman 's cloth cost . you onli glanc at her , rod , you did n't _look_ . if you had , you 'd have seen . everyth she wore was just right . '' susan 's eye were brilliant . `` oh , it was wonder ! the color -- the fit -- the style -- the make -- everi big and littl thing . she was a work of art , rod ! that 's the first woman i ve seen in my life that i through and through envi . '' rod 's look was interest now . `` you like that sort of thing a lot ? '' he inquir with affect careless . `` everi woman doe , '' repli she , unsuspici . `` but i care -- well , not for mere fine cloth . but for the -- the kind that show what sort of person is in them . '' she sigh . `` i wonder if i ll ever learn -- and have money enough to carri out . it'll take so much -- so much ! '' she laugh . `` i ve got terribl extravag idea . but do n't be alarm -- i keep them chain up . '' he was eye her unpleas . sudden she becam confus . he thought it was becaus she was see and understand his look and was frighten at his have caught her at last . in fact , it was becaus it all at onc struck her that what she had innoc and careless said sound like a hint or a reproach to him . he sneer : '' so you re crazi about fineri -- eh ? '' `` oh , rod ! '' she cri . `` you know i did n't mean it that way . i long for and dream about a whole lot of beauti thing , but noth els in the world 's in the same class with -- with what we ve got . '' `` you need n't tri to excus yourself , '' said he in a tone that silenc her . she wish she had not seen the woman who had thus put a cloud over their afternoon 's happi . but long after she had forgotten his queer about what she said , she continu to rememb that `` perfect '' woman -- to see everi detail of her exquisit toilet , so rare in a world where expensive-look fineri is regard as the chief factor in the art of dress . how much she would have to learn befor she could hope to dress like that ! -- learn not mere about dress but about the whole artist side of life . for that woman had happen to cross susan vision at just the right moment -- in develop and in mood -- to reveal to her clear a world into which she had never penetr -- a world of which she had vagu dream as she read novel of life in the land beyond the sea , the life of palac and pictur and statuari , of opera and theater , of equipag and servant and food and cloth of rare qualiti . she had rather thought such a life did not exist outsid of novel and dream . what she had seen of new york -- the profus , the gigant but also the undiscrimin -- had tend to strengthen the suspicion . but this woman prove her mistaken . our great forward stride are made unconsci , are the result of appar trivial , often unnot impuls . susan , like all our race , had alway had vagu secret dream of ambit -- so vagu thus far that she never thought of them as impel purpos in her life . her first long forward stride toward chang these dream from the vagu to the definit was when rod , befor her on the hors on the way to brooksburg , talk over his shoulder to her of the stage and made her feel that it was the life for her , the onli life open to her where a woman could hope to be judg as human be instead of as mere instrument of sex . her second long forward movement toward sharpli defin ambit date from the sight of the woman of the millin 's window -- the woman who epitom to susan the whole art side of life that alway give it highest express in some person achiev -- the perfect toilet , the perfect paint or sculptur , the perfect novel or play . but rod saw in her enthusiasm onli evid of a conceal long for the money to indulg extravag whim . with his narrow interest in women -- narrow now almost to sex -- his contempt for them as to their mind and their heart was so far advanc that he hard took the troubl to veil it with remnant of courtesi . if susan had clear understood -- even if she had let herself understand what her increas knowledg might have enabl her to understand -- she would have hate him in spite of the hold gratitud and habit had given him upon her loyal natur -- and despit the fact that she had , as far as she could see , no altern to live with him but the tenement or the street . one day in midsumm she chanc to go into the hotel astor to buy a magazin . as she had not been there befor she made a wrong turn and was forc to cross one of the restaur . in a far corner , half hidden by a group of palm , she saw rod at a small tabl with a strike pretti woman whose express and dress and manner most energet proclaim the actress . the woman was lean toward him , was touch his hand and look into his eye with that show of enthusiasm which rais doubt of sincer in an experienc man and set him to keep an eye or a hand -- or both -- upon his money . real emot , even a profession expert at display of emot , is rare so adept at exhibit itself . it may have been jealousi that guid her to this swift judgment upon the charact of the emot correct and charm express itself . if so , jealousi was for onc a trustworthi guid . she turn swift and escap unseen . the idea of trap him , of confront him , never occur to her . she felt asham and self-reproach that she had seen . instead of the anger that fire a vain woman , whether she care about a man or not , there came a profound humili . she had in some way fallen short ; she had not given him all he need ; it must be that she had n't it to give , sinc she had given him all she had . he must not know -- he must not ! for if he knew he might dislik her , might leav her -- and she dare not think what life would be without him , her onli sourc of companionship and affect , her onli mean of support . she was puzzl that her discoveri , not of his treacheri -- he had so broken her spirit with his suspicion and his insult question that she did not regard herself as of the rank and digniti that has the right to exact fidel -- but of his no longer care enough to be content with her alon , had not stun her with amaz . she did not realiz how complet the instinct that he was estrang from her had prepar her for the thing that alway accompani estrang . between the perfect accord , that is , the never realiz ideal for a man and a woman live togeth , and the intoler discord that mean complet repuls there is a vast rang of state of feel impercept shade into each other . most coupl constant move along this rang , now toward the one extrem , now toward the other . as human king are not given to self-analysi , and usual wander into grotesqu error whenev they attempt it , no coupl know precis where it is upon the rang , until someth crucial happen to compel them to know . susan and rod had begun as all coupl begin -- with an imaginari ideal accord base upon their ignor of each other and their misunderstand of what qualiti they thought they understood in each other . the delus of accord vanish that first even in new york . what remain ? what came in the place ? they knew no more about that than doe the next coupl . they were simpli `` live along . '' a crisi , draw them close togeth or fling them forev apart or forc them to live togeth , he frank as keeper and she frank as kept , might come ani day , ani hour . again it might never come . after a few week the matter that had been out of her mind accident and indirect came to the surfac in a chanc remark . she said : '' sometim i half believ a man could be untru to a woman , even though he love her . '' she did not appreci the bear of her remark until it was spoken . with a sensat of terror lest the dread crisi might be about to burst , she felt his quick , nervous glanc . she breath freeli again when she felt his reassur and relief as she success withstood . `` certain , '' he said with elabor careless . `` men are a rotten , promiscu lot . that 's whi it 's necessari for a woman to be good and straight . '' all this time his cross-examin had grown in sever . evid he was fear that she might be have a recurr of the moral diseas which was fatal in womankind , though onli mild indiscret in a man , if not posit a virtu , an evid of possess a normal masculin natur . her mind began curious -- sad -- to revolv the occasion present -- of money , of book , of thing to wear -- which he gave , alway quit unexpect . at first unconsci , but soon conscious , she began to associ these gift , given alway in an embarrass , shamefac way , with certain small but signific indic of his have stray . and it was not long befor she understood ; she was receiv his expiat for his indiscret . like an honest man and a loyal -- masculin loyal -- lover he was squar account . she never read the book she owe to these twing ; it was thus that she got her avers to thackeray -- one of his `` expiat '' was a set of thackeray . the thing to wear she contriv never to use . the conscienc money she either spent upon him or put back into his pocket a littl at a time , sure that he , the most careless of men about money , would never detect her . his work forc him to keep irregular hour ; thus she could pretend to herself that his absenc were certain becaus of offic duti . still , whenev he was gone overnight , she becam unhappi -- not the cri kind of unhappi ; to that she was littl given -- but the kind that lie awak and ach and with morbid vivid fanci paint the scene suspicion suggest , and stare at them not in anger but in despair . she was alway urg herself to content herself with what she was get . she recal and live again the thing she had forgotten while roderick was wholli her -- the penalti of the birth brand of shame -- her wed night -- the miseri of the last period of her wander with burlingham -- her tenement day -- the dirt , the naked , the brutal degrad , the vermin , the savag cold . and the instant he return , no matter how low-spirit she had been , she was at onc gay , often deliri gay -- until soon his awaken suspicion as to what she had been up to in his absenc quiet her . there was littl forc or pretens in this gayeti ; it bubbl and sparkl from the strong swift current of her healthi passion young life which , suspend in the ici clutch of fear when he was away from her , flow as freeli as the brook in spring as soon as she realiz that she still had him . did she realli love him ? she believ she did . was she right ? love is of mani degre -- and kind . and strang and confus beyond untangl is the mixtur of motiv and idea in the mind of ani human be as to ani other be with whom his or her relat are mani side . anyon who had not been rough seiz by destini and forc to fight desper weaponless might have found it difficult to understand how this intellig , high-spirit girl could be so reason -- coars practic , mani peopl would have said . a brave soul -- truli brave with the unconsci courag that live heroic without ani taint of heroic -- such a soul learn to accept the fact of life , to make the best of thing , to be grate for whatev sunshin may be and not to shriek and gesticul at storm . suffer had given this sapl of a girl the strong fiber that enabl a tree to push majest up toward the open sky . becaus she did not cri out was no sign that she was not hurt ; and becaus she did not wither and die of her wound was onli proof of her strength of soul . the weak wail and the weak succumb ; the strong persist -- and a world of wailer and weakl call them hard , insens , coars . spenser was fond of exhibit to his men friend -- to some of them -- this treasur to which he alway return the more enamour for his vagari and it opportun of comparison . women he would not permit . in general , he held that all women , the respect no less than the other kind , put mischief in each other 's head and eg each other on to carri out the mischief alreadi there in embryo . in particular , he would have felt that he was commit a gross breach of the proprieti , not to say the decenc , had he introduc a woman of susan origin , histori and present status to the wive and sister of his friend ; and , for reason which it was not necessari even to pretend to conceal from her , he forbad her have anyth to do with the kind of woman who would not have mind , had they known all about her . thus , her onli acquaint , her onli associ , were certain care select men . he ask to dinner or to the theater or to supper at jack 's or rector 's onli such men as he could trust . and trustworthi meant physic unattract . have small and dwindl belief in the mental of women , and no belief whatev in mental as a forc in the relat of the sex , he was satisfi to have about her ani man , howev clever , provid he was absolut devoid of physic charm . the friend who came oftenest was drumley , an editori writer who had been his chum at colleg and had got him the place on the _herald_ . drumley he would have trust alon with her on a desert island ; for sever reason , all of his person conveni , it pleas him that susan like drumley and was glad of his compani , no matter how often he came or how long he stay . drumley was an emaci kentucki giant with grotesqu slope shoulder which not all the ingeni pad of his tailor could appreci mitig . his spare leg were bow in the calv . his skin look rough and tough , like sandpap and emeri board . the thought of touch his face gave one the same sensat as a too deepli cut nail . his neck was thin and long , and he wore a low collar -- through that interest passion of the vain for see a defect in themselv as a charm and call attent to it . the lower part of his sallow face suggest weak -- the weak so often seen in the face of profession men , and explain whi they chose passiv instead of activ career . his forehead was realli fine , but the develop of the rest of the cranium abov the protuber littl ear was not altogeth satisfi to a claim of mental power . drumley was a good sort -- not so much through posit virtu as through the timid which too often account for good , that is , for the meek conform which pass as good . he was an insati reader , had incred store of knowledg ; and as he had a larg vocabulari and a readi speech he could dole out of those reservoir an agreeabl treacl of commonplac philosophi or comment -- thus he had an ideal equip for editori write . he was absolut without physic magnet . the most he could ever expect from ani woman was respect ; and that woman would have had to be foolish enough not to realiz that there is as abysm a differ between knowledg and mental as there is between reput and charact . susan like him becaus he knew so much . she had develop still further her innat passion for educ herself . she now want to know all about everyth . he told her what to read , set her in the way to discov and acquir the art of read -- an art he was himself capabl of acquir onli in it rudiment -- an art the exist of which is entir unsuspect by most person who regard themselv and are regard as reader . he knew the histori and biographi that are most amus and least shallow and mendaci . he instruct her in the great playwright and novelist and poet , and gave -- as his own -- the reason for their great assign by the world 's foremost critic writer . he show her what scientif book to read -- those that do not bore and do not hide the simpl fascin fact about the univers under pretenti , college-professor phraseolog . he was a pedant , but his pedantri was disguis , therefor mitig by his have associ with men of the world instead of with the pale and pompous capon of the student 's closet . his favorit topic was beauti and ugli -- and his abhorr for anyon who was not good to look at . as he talk this subject , his hearer were nervous and embarrass . he was a drastic cure for physic vaniti . if this man could so far deceiv himself that he thought himself handsom , who in all the world could be sure he or she was not the victim of the same incred delus ? it was this hallucin of physic beauti that caus rod to regard him as the safest of the safe . for it made him piti and ridicul . at first he came onli with spenser . afterward , spenser use to send him to dine with susan and to spend the even with her when he himself had to be -- or wish to be elsewher . when she was with drumley he knew she was not `` up to ani of her old trick . '' drumley fell in love with her ; but , as in his experi the femal sex was cold chast , he never develop even the slight hope necessari to start in a man 's mind the idea of treacheri to his friend about a woman . whenev drumley heard that a woman other than the brazen out and out disreput was `` loos '' or was inclin that way , he indign deni it as a libel upon the empedest sex . if proof beyond disput were furnish , he rave against the man with all the venom of the unsuccess hate the success for their success . he had been sought of women , of cours , for he had a comfort and secur posit and money put by . but the serious women who had set snare for him for the sake of a home had not attract him ; as for the better look and liveli women who had come a-court with alimoni in view , they had unwis chosen the method of approach that caus him to set them down as noth but profession loos charact . thus his high ideal of feminin beauti and his lofti notion of his own desert , on the one hand , and his rever for woman proprieti , on the other hand , had kept his charm and his incom unshar . toward the end of spenser 's first year on the _herald_ -- it was earli summer -- he fell into a melancholi so profound and so prolong that susan becam alarm . she was use to his have those fit of the blue that are a part of the nervous , morbid sensit natur and in the unhealth of an irregular and dissip life recur at brief interv . he spent more and more time with her , becam as ardent as in their first day togeth , with an ad desper of passion cling that touch her to the depth . she had earli learn to ignor his mood , to avoid sympathi which aggrav , and to meet his blue with a vigor counterirrit of liveli . after watch the cours of this acut attack for more than a month , she decid that at the first opportun she would tri to find out from drumley what the caus was . perhap she could cure him if she were not work in the dark . one june even drumley came to take her to dinner at the casino in central park . she hesit . she still like drumley mind ; but latter he had fallen into the way of gaze furtiv , with a repuls tremul of his loos eyelid , at her form and at her ankl -- especi at her ankl -- especi at her ankl . this furtiv debauch gave her a shiveri sens of intrus . she distinct like the candid , even the not too coars , glanc of the usual man . but not this shi peep . howev , as there were book she particular wish to talk about with him , she accept . it was an excurs of which she was fond . they stroll along seventh avenu to the park , enter and follow the love walk , quiet and green and odor , to the mall . they saunter in the fade light up the broad mall , with it roof of bough of majest tree , with it pale blue vista of well-kept lawn . at the step lead to the casino they paus to delight in the profus bloom wistaria and to gaze away northward into and over what seem an endless forest with tower and cupola of castl and fortress and cathedr rise seren and grace here and there abov the sea of green . there was the sound of tinkl fountain , the music chink-chink of har chain of eleg equipag ; on the mall hundr of children were play furious , to enjoy to the uttermost the last few moment befor be snatch away to bed -- and the bird were in the same hyster state as they got readi for their even song . the air was satur with the fresh odor of spring and earli summer flower . susan , walk besid the home drumley , was a charm and stylish figur of girlish womanhood . the year and three month in new york had wrought the same transform in her that are so notic whenev an intellig and observ woman with tast for the luxuri is dip in the magic of citi life . she had grown , was now perhap a shade abov the medium height for women , look even taller becaus of the slender of her arm , of her neck , of the line of her figur . there was a deeper melancholi in her violet-gray eye . experi had increas the allur of her wide , beauti curv mouth . they took a tabl under the tree , with bed of bloom flower on either hand . drumley order the sort of dinner she like , and a bottl of champagn and a bottl of fine burgundi to make his favorit drink -- champagn and burgundi , half and half . he was run to poetri that even -- keat and swinburn . final , after some hesit , he produc a poem by dowson -- '' i ran across it today . it 's the onli thing of his worth while , i believ -- and it 's so fine that swinburn must have been sore when he read it becaus he had n't thought to write it himself . it moral tone is not high , but it 's so beauti , mrs. susan , that i ll ventur to show it to you . it come nearer to express what men mean by the man sort of constanc than anyth i ever read . listen to this : `` i cri for madder music and for stronger wine , but when the feast is finish , and the lamp expir , then fall thi shadow , cynara ! -- the night is thine ; and i am desol and sick of an old passion , yea , hungri for the lip of my desir ; i have been faith to thee , cynara , in my fashion . '' susan took the paper , read the four stanza sever time , hand it back to him without a word . `` do n't you think it fine ? '' ask he , a littl uneasili -- he was alway uneasi with a woman when the convers touch the relat of the sex -- uneasi lest he might say or might have said someth to send a shiver through her delic modesti . `` fine , '' susan echo absent . `` and true . . . . i suppos it is the best a woman can expect -- to be the one he return to . and -- is n't that enough ? '' `` you are veri differ from ani woman i ever met , '' said drumley . `` veri differ from what you were last fall -- wonder differ . but you were differ then , too . '' `` i 'd have been a strang sort of person if it were n't so . i'v led a differ life . i ve learn -- becaus i ve had to learn . '' `` you ve been through a great deal -- suffer a great deal for one of your age ? '' susan shrug her shoulder slight . she had her impuls to confid , but she had yet to meet the person who serious tempt her to yield to them . not even rod ; no , least of all rod . `` you are -- happi ? '' `` happi -- and more . i 'm content . '' the repli was the truth , as she saw the truth . perhap it was also the absolut truth ; for when a woman has the best she has ever actual possess , and when she know there is nowher els on earth for her , she is like to be content . their destini of subordin has made philosoph of women . drumley seem to be debat how to disclos someth he had in mind . but after sever glanc at the sweet , delic face of the girl , he gave it over . in the subdu light from the shade candl on their tabl , she look more child-lik than he had ever seen . perhap her big pale-blu hat and grace pale-blu summer dress had someth to do with it , also . `` how old are you ? '' he ask abrupt . `` near nineteen . '' `` i feel like say , so much ! ' -- and also so littl ! ' how long have you been marri ? '' `` whi all these question ? '' demand she , smile . he color with embarrass . `` i did n't mean to be impertin , '' said he . `` it is n't impertin -- is it ? -- to ask a woman how long she been marri . '' but she did not go on to tell him ; instead , she pretend to have her attent distract by a veri old man and a veri young girl behav in most lover-lik fashion , the girl outdo the man in enthusiast determin to convinc . she was eleg and bad dress in new cloth -- and she seem as new to that kind of cloth as those particular cloth were new to her . after dinner they walk down through the park by the way they had come ; it did not look like the same scene now , with the moonlight upon it , with soft shadow everywher and in everi shadow a pair of lover . they had near reach the entranc when drumley said : `` let 's sit on this bench here . i want to have a serious talk with you . '' susan seat herself and wait . he lit a cigar with the deliber of one who is strive to gain time . the bench happen to be one of those that are divid by iron arm into individu seat . he sat with a compart between them . the moonbeam struck across his profil as he turn it toward her ; they shone full upon her face . he look , hastili glanc away . with a gruff as if the even mist had got into his throat he said : '' let 's take anoth bench . '' `` whi ? '' object she . `` i like this beauti light . '' he rose . `` pleas let me have my way . '' and he led her to a bench across which a tree threw a deep shadow ; as they sat there , neither could see the other 's face except in dimmest outlin . after a brief silenc he began : '' you love rod -- do n't you ? '' she laugh happili . `` abov everyth on earth ? '' `` or in heaven . '' `` you 'd do anyth to have him succeed ? '' `` no one could prevent his succeed . he 's got it in him . it bound to come out . '' `` so i 'd have said -- until a year ago -- that is , about a year ago . '' as her face turn quick toward him , he turn profil to her . `` what do you mean ? '' said she , quick , almost imperi . `` yes -- i mean _you_ , '' repli he . `` you mean you think i 'm hinder him ? '' when drumley 's voic final came , it was funer solemn . `` you are drag him down . you are kill his ambit . '' `` you do n't understand , '' she protest with pain express . `` if you did , you would n't say that . '' `` you mean becaus he is not true to you ? '' `` is n't he ? '' said she , loyal tri to pretend surpris . `` if that 's so , you ve no right to tell me -- you , his friend . if it is n't , you -- -- '' '' in either case i 'd be beneath contempt -- unless i knew that you knew alreadi . oh , i ve known a long time that you knew -- ever sinc the night you look away when he absent-mind pull a woman 's veil and glove out of his pocket . i ve watch you sinc then , and i know . '' `` you are a veri dear friend , mr. drumley , '' said she . `` but you must not talk of him to me . '' `` i must , '' he repli . and he hasten to make the self-fool hypocrit 's familiar move to the safeti of duti 's skirt . `` it would be a crime to keep silent . '' she rose . `` i ca n't listen . it may be your duti to speak . it 's my duti to refus to hear . '' `` he is overwhelm with debt . he is about to lose his posit . it is all becaus he is degrad -- becaus he feel he is entangl in an intrigu with a woman he is asham to love -- a woman he has struggl in vain to put out of his heart . '' susan , sudden weak , had seat herself again . from his first word she had been prey to an intern struggl -- her heart fight against understand thing about her relat with rod , about his feel toward her , which she had long been contriv to hide from herself . when drumley began she knew that the end of self-decept was at hand -- if she let him speak . but the instant he had spoken , the struggl end . if he had tri to stop she would have compel him to go on . `` that woman is you , '' he continu in the same solemn measur way . `` rod will not marri you . he can not leav you . and you are drag him down . you are young . you do n't know that passion love is a man 's worst enemi . it satisfi his ambit -- whi struggl when one alreadi has attain the climax of desir ? it sap his strength , take from him the energi without which achiev is imposs . passion die poison of it own sweet . but passion love kill -- at least , it kill the man . if you did not love him , i 'd not be talk to you now . but you do love him . so i say , you are kill him . . . . do n't think he has told me -- -- '' '' i know he did n't , '' she interrupt curt . `` he doe not whine . '' she had n't a doubt of the truth of her loyal defens . and drumley could not have rais a doubt , even if she had been see the express of his face . his long practic of the modern editori art of clear and breviti and compact statement had enabl him to put into those few sentenc more than anoth might have been unabl to express in hour of explan and appeal . and the idea were not new to her . rod had often talk them in a general way and she had thought much about them . until now she had never seen how they appli to rod and herself . but she was see and feel it now so acut that if she had tri to speak or to move she could not have done so . after a long paus , drumley said : `` do you comprehend what i mean ? '' she was silent -- so it was certain that she comprehend . `` but you do n't believ ? . . . he began to borrow money almost immedi on his arriv here last summer . he has been borrow ever sinc -- from everybodi and anybodi . he owe now , as near as i can find out , upward of three thousand dollar . '' susan made a slight but sharp movement . `` you do n't believ me ? '' `` yes . go on . '' `` he has it in him , i 'm confid , to write play -- strong play . doe he ever write except ephemer space stuff for the paper ? '' `` no . '' `` and he never will so long as he has you to go home to . he live beyond his mean becaus he will have you in comfort surround and dress to stimul his passion . if he would marri you , it might be a littl better -- though still he would never amount to anyth as long as his love last -- the kind of love you inspir . but he will never marri you . i learn that from what i know of his idea and from what i ve observ as to your relat -- not from anyth he ever said about you . '' if susan had been of the suspici tempera , or if she had been a few year older , the manner of this second protest might have set her to think how unlik drumley , the inexpert in matter of love and passion , it was to analyz thus and to form such judgment . and thenc she might have gone on to consid that drumley 's speech sound strang like paraphras of spenser 's eloqu outburst when he `` got go . '' but she had not a suspicion . besid , her whole be was concentr upon the idea drumley was tri to put into word . she ask : '' whi are you tell me ? '' `` becaus i love him , '' repli drumley with feel . `` we re about the same age , but he 's been like my son ever sinc we struck up a friendship in the first term of freshman year . '' `` is that your onli reason ? '' `` on my honor . '' and so firm did he believ it , he bore her scrutini as she peer into his face through the dim . she drew back . `` yes , '' she said in a low voic , half to herself . `` yes , i believ it is . '' there was silenc for a long time , then she ask quiet : '' what do you think i ought to do ? '' `` leav him -- if you love him , '' repli drumley . `` what els can you do ? . . . stay on and complet his ruin ? '' `` and if i go -- what ? '' `` oh , you can do ani one of mani thing . you can -- -- '' '' i mean -- what about him ? '' `` he will be like a crazi man for a while . he ll make that a fresh excus for keep on as he 's go now . then he ll brace up , and i ll be watch over him , and i ll put him to work in the right direct . he ca n't be save , he ca n't even be kept afloat as long as you are with him , or within reach . with you gone out of his life -- his strength will return , his self-respect can be rous . i ve seen the same thing in other case again and again . i could tell you ani number of stori of -- -- '' '' he doe not care for me ? '' `` in _one_ way , a great deal . but you re like drink , like a drug to him . it is strang that a woman such as you , devot , single-heart , utter love , should be an influenc for bad . but it 's true of wive also . the best wive are often the worst . the philosoph are right . a man need tranquil at home . '' `` i understand , '' said she . `` i understand -- perfect . '' and her voic was unemot , as alway when she was so deepli move that she dare not releas anyth lest all should be releas . she was like a seat statu . the moon had move so that it shone upon her face . he was astonish by it placid calm . he had expect her to rave and weep , to protest and plead -- befor denounc him and bid him mind his own busi . instead , she was make it clear that after all she did not care about roderick ; probabl she was wonder what would becom of her , now that her love was ruin . well , was n't it natur ? was n't it altogeth to her credit -- was n't it addit proof that she was a fine pure woman ? how could she have continu deepli to care for a man scandal untru , and drunk much of the time ? certain , it was in no way her fault that rod made her the object and the victim of the onli kind of so-cal love of which he was capabl . no doubt one reason he was untru to her was that she was too pure for his debauch fanci . thus reason drumley with that mingl of truth and error characterist of those who specul about matter of which they have small and unfix experi . `` about yourself , '' he proceed . `` i have a choic of profess for you -- one with a compani on the road -- on the southern circuit -- with good prospect of advanc . i know , from what i have seen of you , and from talk we have had , that you would do well on the stage . but the life might offend your sensibl . i should hesit to recommend it to a delic , fine-fib woman like you . the other posit is a clerkship in a busi offic in philadelphia -- with an increas as soon as you learn stenographi and typewrit . it is respect . it is shelter . it doe n't offer anyth brilliant . but except the stage and literatur , noth brilliant offer for a woman . literatur is out of the question , i think -- certain for the present . the stage is n't realli a place for a woman of lady-lik instinct . so i should recommend the offic posit . '' she remain silent . `` while my main purpos in talk to you , '' he continu , `` was to tri to save him , i can honest say that it was hard less my intent to save you . but for that , i 'd not have had the courag to speak . he is on the way down . he 's drag you with him . what futur have you with him ? you would go on down and down , as low as he should sink and lower . you ve complet merg yourself in him -- which might do veri well if you were his wife and a good influenc in his life or a mere negat like most wive . but in the circumst it mean ruin to you . don't you see that ? '' `` what did you say ? '' `` i was talk about you -- your futur your -- -- '' '' oh , i shall do well enough . '' she rose . `` i must be go . '' her short , indiffer dismiss of what was his real object in speak -- though he did not permit himself to know it -- cut him to the quick . he felt a sicken and to him inexplic sens of defeat and disgrac . becaus he must talk to distract his mind from himself , he began afresh by say : '' you ll think it over ? '' `` i am think it over . . . . i wonder that -- -- '' with the finger of one hand she smooth her glove on the finger of the other -- '' i wonder that i did n't think of it long ago . i ought to have thought of it . i ought to have seen . '' `` i ca n't tell you how i hate to have been the -- -- '' '' pleas do n't say ani more , '' she request in a tone that made it imposs for a man so timid as he to disobey . neither spoke until they were in fifty-ninth street ; then he , unabl to stand the strain of a silent walk of fifteen block , suggest that they take the car down . she assent . in the car the stronger light enabl him to see that she was pale in a way quit differ from her usual clear , healthi pallor , that there was an unfamiliar look about her mouth and her eye -- a look of strain , of repress , of resolv . these sign and the contrast of her mute motionless with her usual vivac of speech and express and gestur made him uneasi . `` i 'd advis , '' said he , `` that you reflect on it all care and consult with me befor you do anyth -- if you think you ought to do anyth . '' she made no repli . at the door of the hous he had to reach for her hand , and her answer to his good night was a vagu absent echo of the word . `` i ve onli done what i saw was my duti , '' said he , appeal . `` yes , i suppos so . i must go in . '' `` and you ll talk with me befor you -- -- '' the door had close behind her ; she had not known he was speak . when spenser came , about two hour later , and turn on the light in their bedroom , she was in the bed , appar asleep . he stood stare with theatric self-consci at himself in the glass for sever minut , then sat down befor the bureau and pull out the third drawer -- where he kept collar , tie , handkerchief , glove and a pistol conceal under the handkerchief . with the aw solemn of the youth who take himself -- and the theater -- serious he lift the pistol , eye it critic , turn it this way and that as if interest in the reflect of light from the bright cylind and barrel at differ angl . he laid it noiseless back , cover it over with the handkerchief , sat with his finger rest on the edg of the drawer . present he move uneasili , as a man -- on the stage or in it amus imit call civil life among the self-consci class -- move when he feel that someon is behind him in a `` crucial moment . '' he slowli turn round . she had shift her posit so that her face was now toward him . but her eye were close and her face was tranquil . still , he hope she had seen the littl episod of the pistol , which he thought fine and impress . with his arm on the back of the chair and support that resolute-look chin of his , he stare at her face from under his thick eyebrow , so thick that although they were almost as fair as his hair they seem dark . after a while her eyelid flutter and lift to disclos eye that startl him , so intens , so sleepless were they . `` kiss me , '' she said , in her usual sweet , tender way -- a littl shyness , much of passion 's sparkl and allur . `` kiss me . '' `` i ve often thought , '' said he , `` what would i do if i should go smash , reach the end of my string ? would i kill you befor take myself off ? or would that be coward ? '' she had not a doubt that he meant this melodramat twaddl . it did not seem twaddl or melodramat to her -- or , for that matter , to him . she clasp him more close . `` what 's the matter , dear ? '' she ask , her head on his breast . `` oh , i ve had a row at the _herald_ , and have quit . but i ll get anoth place tomorrow . '' `` of cours . i wish you 'd fix up that play the way drumley suggest . '' `` mayb i shall . we ll see . '' `` anyth els wrong ?

'' `` i guess so . i do n't know . '' and she drew a long breath , nestl into his arm , and upon his breast , with her perfum hair drows his sens . he soon slept ; when he awok , toward noon , he did not disturb her . he shave and bath and dress , and was about to go out when she call him . `` oh , i thought you were asleep , '' said he . `` i ca n't wait for you to get breakfast . i must get a move on . '' `` still blue ? '' `` no , inde . '' but his face was not convinc . `` so long , pet . '' `` are n't you go to kiss me good-bi ? '' he laugh tender , yet in bitter self-mockeri too . `` and wast an hour or so ? not much . what a siren you are ! '' she put her hand over her face quick . `` now , perhap i can risk one kiss . '' he bent over her ; his lip touch her hair . she stretch out her hand , laid it against his cheek . `` dearest , '' she murmur . `` i must go . '' `` just a minut . no , do n't look at me . turn your face so that i can see your profil -- so ! '' she had turn his head with a hand that gentl caress as it push . `` i like that view best . yes , you are strong and brave . you will succeed ! no -- i ll not keep you a minut . '' she kiss his hand , rest her head for an instant on his lap as he sat on the edg of the bed , sudden flung herself to the far side of the bed , with her face toward the wall . `` go to sleep again , lazi ! '' cri he . `` i ll tri to be home about dinner-tim . see that you behav today ! good lord , how hard it is to leav you ! have you make noth els seem worth while . good-bi ! '' and he was off . she start to a sit postur , listen to the faint sound of his descend footstep . she dart to the window , lean out , watch him until he round the corner into broadway . then she drop down with elbow on the window sill and hand press her cheek ; she stare unse at the opposit hous , at a gilt cage with a canari hop and chirp within . and onc more she thought all the thought that had fill her mind in the sleepless hour of that night and morn . her eye shift in color from pure gray to pure violet -- back and forth , as emot or thought domin her mind . she made herself coffe in the french machin , heat the milk she brought everi day from the dairi , drank her _cafe au lait_ slowli , read the newspap advertis for `` help want -- femal '' -- a habit she had form when she first came to new york and had never altogeth drop . when she finish her coffe she took the scissor and cut out sever of the demand for help . she bath and dress . she move through the routin of life -- precis as we all do , whatev may be in our mind and heart . she went out , cross long acr and enter the shop of a dealer in women 's cast-off cloth . she reappear in the street present with a fat , sloppi look woman in black . she took her to the room , offer for sale her entir wardrob except the dress she had on and one other , the simpli trim sailor upon her head , the tie on her feet and one pair of boot and a few small articl . after long haggl the woman made a final price -- ninety-f dollar for thing , most of them almost new , which had cost upward of seven hundr . susan accept the offer ; she knew she could do no better . the woman depart , return with a porter and sever huge sweet of wrap paper . the two made three bundl of the purchas ; the money was paid over ; they and susan 's wardrob depart . next , susan pack in the travel bag she had brought from cincinnati the between season dress of brown serg she had withheld , and some such collect of bare necess as she had taken with her when she left georg warham 's . into the bag she put the pistol from under spenser 's handkerchief in the third bureau drawer . when all was readi , she sent for the maid to straighten the room . while the maid was at work , she wrote this note : dearest -- mr. drumley will tell you whi i have gone . you will find some money under your handkerchief in the bureau . when you are on your feet again , i may come -- if you want me . it wo n't be ani use for you to look for me . i ought to have gone befor , but i was selfish and blind . good-bi , dear love -- i was n't so bad as you alway suspect . i was true to you , and for the sake of what you have been to me and done for me i could n't be so ungrat as not to go . do n't worri about me . i shall get on . and so will you . it 's best for us both . good-bi , dear heart -- i was true to you . good-bi . she seal this note , address it , fasten it over the mantel in the sitting-room where they alway put note for each other . and after she had look in each drawer and in the closet at all his cloth , and had kiss the pillow on which his head had lain , she took her bag and went . she had left for him the ninety-f dollar and also eleven dollar of the money she had in her purs . she took with her two five-dollar bill and a dollar and forti cent in chang . the violet wane in her eye , and in it stead came the gray of thought and action . * * * * * * * * the end of volum i * * * * * * * susan lenox : her fall and rise by david graham phillip volum ii with a portrait of the author d. appleton and compani new york london 1917 chapter i susan 's impuls was toward the stage . it had becom a definit ambit with her , the stronger becaus spenser jealousi and suspicion had forc her to keep it a secret , to pretend to herself that she had no thought but go on indefinit as his obedi and devot mistress . the hardiest and best growth are the growth inward -- where they have sun and air from without . she had been at the theater sever time everi week , and had studi the perform at a point of view veri differ from that of the audienc . it was there to be amus ; she was there to learn . spenser and such of his friend as he would let meet her talk play and act most of the time . he had forbidden her to have women friend . `` men do n't demor women ; women demor each other , '' was one of his axiom . but such women as she had a bow acquaint with were all on the stage -- in comic opera or music farc . she was much alon ; that meant mani hour everi day which could not but be spent by a mind like her in read and in think . onli those who have observ the differ alon make in mental develop , where there is a good mind , can appreci how rapid , how broad , susan expand . she read play more than ani other kind of literatur . she did not read them casual but was alway think how they would act . she was soon make in imagin stage scene out of dramat chapter in novel as she read . more and more clear the charact of play and novel took shape and substanc befor the eye of her fanci . but the stage was clear out of the question . while the idea of a stage career had been domin , she had thought in other direct , also . everi sunday , inde almost everi day , she found in the newspap articl on the subject of work for women . `` whi do you wast time on that stuff ? '' said drumley , when he discov her tast for it . `` oh , a woman never can tell what may happen , '' repli she . `` she ll never learn anyth from those fool articl , '' answer he . `` you ought to hear the peopl who get them up laugh about them . i see now whi they are print . it 's good for circul , catch the women -- even women like you . '' howev , she persist in read . but never did she find an articl that contain a realli practic suggest -- that is , one appli to the case of a woman who had to live on what she made at the start , who was without experi and without a famili to help her . all around her had been women who were make their way ; but few inde of them -- even of those regard as success -- were get along without outsid aid of some kind . so when she read or thought or inquir about work for women , she was sometim amus and often made unhappi by the truth as to the condit , that when a common worker rise it is almost alway by the help hand of a man , and rare inde a generous hand -- a pain and shame truth which a societi resolv at ani cost to think well of itself fierc conceal from itself and hypocrit lie about . she felt now that there was hope in onli one direct -- hope of occup that would enabl her to live in physic , moral and mental decenc . she must find some employ where she could as decent as might be realiz upon her physic asset . the stage would be best -- but the stage was imposs , at least for the time . later on she would tri for it ; there was in her mind not a doubt of that , for unsuspect of ani who knew her there lay , beneath her sweet and gentl exterior , beneath her appear of have been creat especi for love and laughter and sympathi , tenac of purpos and dare of ambit that were -- rare -- hint at the surfac in her moment of abstract . howev , just now the stage was imposs . spenser would find her immedi . she must go into anoth part of town , must work at someth that touch his life at no point . she had often been told that her figur would be one of her chief asset as a player . and ready-mad cloth fit her with veri slight alter -- show that she had a model figur . the advertis she had cut out were for cloak model . within an hour after she left forty-fourth street , she found at jeffri and jona , in broadway a few door below houston , a vacanc that had not yet been fill -- though as a rule all the help need was got from the throng of applic wait when the store open . `` come up to my offic , '' said jeffri , who happen to be near the door as she enter . `` we ll see how you shape up . we want someth extra -- someth dainti and catchi . '' he was a short thick man , with flat feet , a flat face and an almost bald head . in his flat nostril , in the hollow of his great forward bent ear and on the lobe were bunch of coars , stiff gray hair . his eyebrow bristl ; his small , sli brown eye twinkl with good natur and with sensual . his skin had the pallor that suggest kidney troubl . his word issu from his thick mouth as if he were tast each beforehand -- and like the flavor . he led susan into his privat offic , close the door , took a tape measur from his desk . `` now , my dear , '' said he , eye her form glutton , `` we'll size you up -- eh ? you re exact the build i like . '' and under the pretens of take her measur , he fumbl and felt , pinch and stroke everi part of her person , laugh and chuckl the while . `` my , but you are sweet ! and so firm ! what flesh ! solid -- solid ! mighti healthi ! you are a good girl -- eh ? '' `` i am a marri woman . '' `` but you ve got no ring . '' `` i ve never worn a ring . '' `` well -- well ! i believ that is one of the new wrinkl , but i do n't approv . i 'm an old-fashion famili man . let me see again . now , do n't mind a poor old man like me , my dear . i'v got a wife -- the best woman in the world , and i ve never been untru to her . a look over the fenc occasion -- but not an inch out of the pastur . do n't stiffen yourself like that . i ca n't judg , when you do . not too much hip -- neither side nor back . fine ! fine ! and the thigh slender -- yes -- quit love , my dear . thick thigh spoil the hang of garment . yes -- yes -- a splendid figur . i ll bet the bosom is a corker -- fine skin and nice ladylik size . you can have the place . '' `` what doe it pay ? '' she ask . `` ten dollar , to start with . splendid wage . _i_ start on two fifti . but i forgot -- you do n't know the busi ? '' `` no -- noth about it , '' was her innoc , honest answer . `` ah -- well , then -- nine dollar -- eh ? '' susan hesit . `` you can make quit a neat littl bunch on the outsid -- _you_ can . we cater onli to the best trade , and the buyer who come to us are big easi spender . but i 'm suppos to know noth about that . you ll find out from the other girl . '' he chuckl . `` oh , it 's a nice soft life except for a few week along at this part of the year -- and again in winter . well -- ten dollar , then . '' susan accept . it was more than she had expect to get ; it was less than she could hope to live on in new york in anyth approach the manner a person of ani refin or tast or custom of comfort regard as mere decent . she must descend again to the tenement , must resum the fight against that physic degrad which sooner or later impos -- upon those _descending_ to it -- a degrad of mind and heart deeper , more satur , more putrefi than ani that ever origin from within . not so long as her figur last was she the wors off for not know a trade . jeffri was tell the truth ; she would be get splendid wage , not mere for a beginn but for ani woman of the work class . except in rare occasion instanc wage and salari for women were kept down below the standard of decenc by woman 's peculiar posit -- by such condit as that most women took up work as a temporari makeshift or to piec out a famili 's earn , and that almost ani woman could supplement -- and so mani did supplement -- their earn at labor with as larg or larger earn in the stealthi shame way . where was there a trade that would bring a girl ten dollar a week at the start ? even if she were a semi-profession , a stenograph and typewrit , it would take expert and long servic to lift her up to such wage . thank to her figur -- to it chanc to pleas old jeffri tast -- she was better off than all but a few work women , than all but a few workingmen . she was of the labor aristocraci ; and if she had been one of a famili of worker she would have been count an enviabl favorit of fortun . unfortun , she was alon unfortun for herself , not at all from the standpoint of the tenement class she was now join . among them she would be a person who could afford the luxuri of life as life reveal itself to the tenement . `` tomorrow morn at seven o'clock , '' said jeffri . `` you have lost your husband ? '' `` yes . '' `` i saw you 'd had great grief . no insur , i judg ? well -- you will find anoth -- mayb a rich one . no -- you ll not have to sleep alon long , my dear . '' and he pat her on the shoulder , gave her a part fumbl of shoulder and arm . she was abl to muster a grate smile ; for she felt a rare kind of heart under the familiar anim to which good-look , well-form women who go about much unescort soon grow accustom . also , experi had taught her that , as thing go with girl of the work class , his treatment was courteous , consider , chivalr almost . with men in absolut control of all kind of work , with women stimul the sex appetit by open or covert use their charm as femal to assist them in the cruel struggl for exist -- what was to be expect ? her way to the elev took her along aisl line with tabl , hidden under mass of cloak , jacket , dress and materi for make them . they exud the odor of the factori -- faint yet pungent odor that brought up befor her vision of huge , bad ventil room , where women age or age swift were toil hour after hour monoton -- spend half of each day in buy the right to eat and sleep unhealthili . the odor -- or , rather , the vision they evok -- made her sick at heart . for the moment she came from under the spell of her peculiar trait -- her power to do without whimper or vain gestur of revolt the inevit thing , whatev it was . she paus to steadi herself , half lean against a lofti up-pil of winter cloak . a girl , young at first glanc , not near so young thereaft , sudden appear befor her -- a girl whose hair had the sheen of burnish brass and whose soft smooth skin was of that frog-belli white which suggest an inherit of some bleach and blister diseas . she had small regular featur , eye that at onc suggest loos , good-natur yet mercenari too . she was dress in the sleek tight-fit trying-on robe of the profession model , and her figur was superb in it firm luxuri . `` sick ? '' ask the girl with real kindli . `` no -- onli dizzi for the moment . '' `` i suppos you ve had a hard day . '' `` it might have been easier , '' susan repli , attempt a smile . `` it 's no fun , look for a job . but you ve caught on ? '' `` yes . he took me . '' `` i made a bet with myself that he would when i saw you go in . '' the girl laugh agreeabl . `` he pick you for gideon . '' `` what depart is that ?

'' `` yes . '' `` um -- '' the girl shook her head dubious . `` rent are mighti steep in new york , and go up all the time . you see , the rich peopl that own the land and hous here need a lot of money in their busi . you ve got either to take a room or part of one in with some tenement famili , respect but noisi and dirti and not at all refin , or els you ve got to live in a hous where everyth goe . you want to live respect , i judg ?

'' `` they ve got to , '' said susan . `` yes , that 's a fact . ai n't it aw ? i ll write down the name and address of my ladi friend . i 'm miss mari hinkl . '' `` my name is lorna sackvill , '' said susan , in respons to the expect look of miss hinkl . `` my , what a swell name ! you ve been sick , have n't you ? '' `` no , i 'm never sick . '' `` me too . my mother taught me to stop eat as soon as i felt bad , and not to eat again till i was all right . '' `` i do that , too , '' said susan . `` is it good for the health ? '' `` it starv the doctor . you ve never work befor ? '' `` oh , yes -- i ve work in a factori . '' miss hinkl look disappoint . then she gave susan a side glanc of incredul . `` i 'd never , a ' thought it . but i can see you were n't brought up to that . i ll write the address . '' and she went back through the showroom , present to reappear with a card which she gave susan . `` you ll find mrs. tucker a perfect ladi -- too much a ladi to get on . i tell her she ll go to ruin -- and she will . '' susan thank miss hinkl and depart . a few minut ' walk brought her to the old , high-stoop , brown-ston where mrs. tucker live . the dent , scratch and old paint scale on the door , the dust-streak window , the sloven hang of the imit lace window curtain proclaim the cheap middle-class lodg or board hous of the humblest grade . respect undoubt ; for the fit prosper offend against law and moral insist upon better accommod . susan 's heart sank . she saw that onc more she was cling at the edg of the precipic . and what hope was there that she would get back to firm ground ? certain not by '' honest labor . '' back to the tenement ! `` yes , i 'm on the way back , '' she said to herself . howev , she pull the loos bell-knob and was admit to a dingi , dusti hallway by a maid so redol of stale perspir that it was notic even in the hall 's strong satur of smell of cheap cookeri . the parlor furnitur was rapid go to piec ; the chromo and print hung crazili awri ; dust lay thick upon the center tabl , upon the chimney-piec , upon the pictur frame , upon the carv in the ricketi old chair . onli by stand did susan avoid servic as a dust rag . it was typic of the profound discourag that blight or blast all but a small area of our modern civil -- a discourag due in part to ignor -- but not at all to the caus usual assign -- to '' natur shiftless . '' it is chiefli due to an unconsci instinct feel of the hopeless of the averag lot . while susan explain to mrs. tucker how she had come and what she could afford , she examin her with result far from disagre . one glanc into that home wrinkl face was enough to convinc anyon of her good of heart -- and to susan in those day of alon , of uncertainti , of the feel of hopeless , good of heart seem the suprem charm . such a woman as a landladi , and a landladi in new york , was pathet absurd . even to still rather simple-mind susan she seem an invit to the swindler , to the sponger with the hard-luck stori , to the sink who clutch about desper and drag down with them everyon who permit them to get a hold . `` i ve onli got one room , '' said mrs. tucker . `` that 's not ani too nice . i did rather calcul to get five a week for it , but you are the kind i like to have in the hous . so if you want it i ll let it to you for fourteen a month . and i do hope you ll pay as steadi as you can . there 's so mani in such hard line that i have a tough time with my rent . i ve got to pay my rent , you know . '' `` i ll go as soon as i ca n't pay , '' repli susan . the landladi 's apologet tone made her sick at heart , as a sensit human be must ever feel in the presenc of a fellow-b doom to disast . `` thank you , '' said mrs. tucker grate . `` i do wish -- -- '' she check herself . `` no , i do n't mean that . they do the best they can -- and i ll botch along somehow . i look at the bright side of thing .

'' she and susan ascend three flight to the top stori -- to a closet of a room at the back . the wall were newli and bright paper . the slope roof of the hous made one wall a ceil also , and in this two small window were set . the furnitur was a tini bed , white and clean as to it linen , a tabl , two chair , a small washstand with a littl bowl and a less pitcher , a soap dish and a mug . along one wall ran a row of hook . on the floor was an old and incred dirti carpet , mitig by a strip of clean mat which ran from the door , between washstand and bed , to one of the window . susan glanc round -- a glanc was enough to enabl her to see all -- all that was there , all that the thing there impli . back to the tenement life ! she shudder . `` it ai n't much , '' said mrs. tucker . `` but usual room like these rent for five a week . '' the sun had heat the roof scorch hot ; the air of this room , immedi underneath , was like that of a cellar where a furnac is in full blast . but susan knew she was inde in luck . `` it 's clean and nice here , '' said she to mrs. tucker , '' and i 'm much oblig to you for be so reason with me . '' and to clinch the bargain she then and there paid half a month 's rent . `` i ll give you the rest when my week at the store 's up . '' `` no hurri , '' said mrs. tucker who was handl the money and look at it with glisten grate eye . `` us poor folk ought n't to be hard on each other -- though , lord know , if we was , i reckon we 'd not be quit so poor . it 's them that has the streak of hard in em what get on . but the bibl teach us that 's what to expect in a world of sin . i suppos you want to go now and have your trunk sent ? '' `` this is all i ve got , '' said susan , indic her bag on the tabl . into mrs. tucker 's face came a look of terror that made susan realiz in an instant how hard-press she must be . it was the kind of look that come into the eye of the deer brought down by the dog when it see the hunter come up . `` but i ve a good place , '' susan hasten to say . `` i get ten a week . and as i told you befor , when i ca n't pay i ll go right away . '' `` i ve lost so much in bad debt , '' explain the landladi humbl . `` i do n't seem to see which way to turn . '' then she brighten . `` it ll all come out for the best . i work hard and i tri to do right by everybodi . '' `` i 'm sure it will , '' said susan believ . often her confid in the moral ideal train into her from childhood had been sore tri . but never had she permit herself more than a hasti , asham doubt that the onli way to get on was to work and to practic the golden rule . everyon who was prosper attribut his prosper to the steadfast follow of that way ; as for those who were not prosper , they were either lazi or bad-heart , or would have been even wors off had they been less faith to the creed that was best polici as well as best for peac of mind and heart . in tri to be as inexpens to spenser as she could contriv , and also becaus of her passion for improv herself , susan had explor far into the almost unknown art of live , on it shame neglect materi side . she had cultiv the habit of spend much time about her purchas of everi kind -- had spent time intellig in save money intellig . she had gone from shop to shop , compar valu and price . she had studi qualiti in food and in cloth , and thus she had discov what enorm sum are wast through ignor -- wast by poor even more lavish than by rich or well-to-do , becaus the shop where the poor dealt had absolut no check on their rapac through the occasion canni custom . she had learn the fundament truth of the materi art of live ; onli when a good thing happen to be cheap is a cheap thing good . spenser , cross-examin her as to how she pass the day , found out about this educ she was acquir . it amus him . `` a wast of time ! '' he use to say . `` pay what they ask , and don't bother your head with such petti matter . '' he might have suspect and accus her of be stingi had not her generos been about the most obvious and incess trait of her charact . she was now reduc to an incom below what life can be decent maintain upon -- the life of a city-dwel with normal tast for cleanli and health . she proceed without delay to put her invalu educ into use . she must fill her mind with the present and with the futur . she must not glanc back . she must ignor her wound -- their ach , their clamor throb . she took off her cloth , as soon as mrs. tucker left her alon , brush them and hung them up , put on the thin wrapper she had brought in her bag . the fierc heat of the littl packing-cas of a room becam less unendur ; also , she was save the cloth from useless wear . she sat down at the tabl and with pencil and paper plan her budget . of the ten dollar a week , three dollar and thirti cent must be subtract for rent -- for shelter . this left six dollar and seventi cent for the other two necessari , food and cloth -- there must be no incident expens sinc there was no money to meet them . she could not afford to provid for carfar on stormi day ; a rain coat , oversho and umbrella , more expens at the outset , were incompar cheaper in the long run . her wash and iron she would of cours do for herself in the even and on sunday . of the two item which the six dollar and seventi cent must cover , food came first in import . how littl could she live on ? that stifl hot room ! she was as wet as if she had come undri from a bath . she had thought she could never feel anyth but love for the sun of her citi of the sun . but this undreamed-of heat -- like the cruel caress of a too impetu lover -- how littl could she live on ? divid her total of six dollar and seventi cent by seven , she found that she had ninety-f cent a day . she would soon have to buy cloth , howev scrupul care she might take of those she possess . it was modest inde to estim fifteen dollar for cloth befor octob . that meant she must save fifteen dollar in the remain three week of june , in juli , august and septemb -- in one hundr and ten day . she must save about fifteen cent a day . and out of that she must buy soap and tooth powder , outer and under cloth , perhap a hat and a pair of shoe . thus she could spend for food not more than eighti cent a day , as much less as was consist with buy the best qualiti -- for she had learn by bitter experi the ravag poor qualiti food make in health and look , had learn whi girl of the work class go to piec swift after eighteen . she must fight to keep health -- sick she did not dare be . she must fight to keep look -- her figur was her incom . eighti cent a day . the outlook was not so gloomi . a cup of cocoa in the morn -- made at home of the best cocoa , the kind that did not overheat the blood and disord the skin -- it would cost her less than ten cent . she would carri lunch with her to the store . in the even she would cook a chop or someth of that kind on the gas stove she would buy . some day she would be abl to save twenti or even twenty-f cent toward cloth and the like . whatev els happen , she was resolv never again to sink to dirt and rag . never again ! -- never ! she had pass through that experi onc without loss of self-respect onli becaus it was by way of educ . to go through it again would be yield ground in the fight -- the fight for a destini worth while which some latent but mighti instinct within her never permit her to forget . she sat at the tabl , with the shutter close against the fieri light of the summer afternoon sun . that hideous unaccept heat ! with eyelid droop -- deep and dark were the circl round them -- she listen to the roar of the citi , a savag sound like the clamor of a multitud of famish wild beast . a citi like the citi of destruct in `` pilgrim progress '' -- a citi where of all the million , but a few thousand were move toward or keep in the sunlight of civil . the rest , the swarm of the cheap board hous , cheap lodg hous , tenement -- these myriad were squirm in dark and squalor , ignor and never to be less ignor , ill fed and never to be better fed , cloth in piti absurd rag or shoddi vulgar attempt at fineri , and never to be better cloth . she would not be of those ! she would struggl on , would sink onli to mount . she would work ; she would tri to do as near right as she could . and in the end she must triumph . she would get at least a good part of what her soul crave , of what her mind crave , of what her heart crave . the heat of this tenement room ! the heat to which poverti was expos nake and bound ! would not anyon be justifi in do anyth -- yes , _anything_ -- to escap from this fiend ? chapter ii ellen , the maid , slept across the hall from susan , in a closet so dirti that no one could have risk in it ani articl of cloth with the least pretens to clean . it was no better , no wors than the lodg of more than two hundr thousand new yorker . it one narrow open , besid the door , gave upon a shaft whose odor were so foul that she kept the window close , prefer heat like the insid of a steam pan to the onli avail `` outsid air . '' this in a civil citi where hundr of dog with jewel collar slept in luxuri room on downiest bed and had servant to wait upon them ! the morn after susan 's come , ellen woke her , as they had arrang , at a quarter befor five . the night befor , susan had brought up from the basement a larg bucket of water ; for she had made up her mind , to take a bath everi day , at least until the cold weather set in and render such a luxuri imposs . with this water and what she had in her littl pitcher , susan contriv to freshen herself up . she had bought a gas stove and some indispens utensil for three dollar and seventeen cent in a fourteenth street store , a pound of cocoa for seventi cent and ten cent ' worth of roll -- three roll , well bake , of first qualiti flour and with about as good butter and other thing put into the dough as one can expect in bread not made at home . these purchas had reduc her cash to forty-thre cent -- and she ought to buy without delay a clock with an alarm attach . and pay day -- saturday -- was two day away . she made a cup of cocoa , drank it slowli , eat one of the roll -- all in the same method way like a machin that continu to revolv after the power has been shut off . it was then , even more than dure her first even alon , even more than when she from time to time startl out of troubl sleep -- it was then , as she forc down her lone breakfast , that she most miss rod . when she had finish , she complet her toilet . the final glanc at herself in the littl mirror was depress . she look fresh for her new surround and for her new class . but in comparison with what she usual look , alreadi there was a distinct , an omin fall off . `` i 'm glad rod never saw me look like this , '' she said aloud drearili . take a roll for lunch , she issu forth at half-past six . the hour and three-quart she had allow for dress and breakfast had been none too much . in the cool and compar quiet she went down univers place and across washington squar under the old tree , all aliv with song and breez and flash of earli morn light . she was soon in broadway 's deep canyon , was drift absent along in the stream of cross , mussy-look worker push southward . her heart ach , her brain throb . it was horribl , this loneli ; and everi one of the wound where she had sever the tie with spenser was bleed . she was astonish to find herself befor the build whose upper floor were occupi by jeffri and jona . how had she got there ? where had she cross broadway ? `` good morn , miss sackvill .

'' susan 's low spirit sank lower . these disagre truth -- for observ and experi made her fear they were truth -- fill her with despond . what was the matter with life ? as between the moral she had been taught and the practic moral of this world upon which she had been cast , which was the right ? how `` take hold '' ? how avert the impend disast ? what of the `` good '' should -- _must_ -- she throw away ? what should -- _must_ -- she cling to ? mari hinkl was shock by the poor littl room . `` this is no place for a ladi !

'' `` it take a mighti good leg to look good in a white stock , '' observ mari . `` but your is so nice and long and slim that they 'd stand most anyth . '' mrs. tucker and ellen stood by with no interfer save suggest and comment , while mari , who at one time work for a hairdress , did susan 's thick dark hair . susan would permit no elabor , much to miss hinkl 's regret . but the three agre that she was right when the simpl sweep of the vital blue-black hair was finish in a loos and grace knot at the back , and susan 's small , healthili pallid face look it loveliest , with the violet-gray eye soft and sweet and serious . mrs. tucker brought the hat from the bed , and susan put it on -- a larg black straw of a most becom shape with two pure white plume curl round the crown and a third , not so long , rise grace from the big buckl where the three plume met . and now came the put on of the dress . with as much care as if they were handl a rare and fragil vase , mari and mrs. tucker held the dress for susan to step into it . ellen kept her petticoat in place while the other two escort the dress up susan 's form . then the three work togeth at hook and smooth . susan wash her hand again , refus to let mrs. tucker run and bring powder , produc from a drawer some prepar chalk and with it safeguard her nose against shine ; she tuck the powder rag into her stock . last of all the glove went on and a small handkerchief was thrust into the palm of the left glove . `` how do i look ?

'' `` you must go right downstair where it 's cool and you wo n't get wilt , '' cri mrs. tucker . `` hold your skirt close on the way . the step and wall ai n't none too clean . '' in the bathroom downstair there was a long mirror built into the wall , a relic of the old hous 's long depart youth of grandeur . as the tenant -- mr. jessop -- was out , mrs. tucker led the way into it . there susan had the first satisfactori look at herself . she knew she was a pretti woman ; she would have been weak-mind had she not known it . but she was amaz at herself . a touch here and there , a sinuous shift of the bodi within the garment , and the suggest of `` dress up '' vanish befor the reflect eye of her agit assist , who did not know what had happen but onli saw the result . she hard knew the tall beauti woman of fashion gaze at her from the mirror . could it be that this was her hair ? -- these eye her -- and the mouth and nose and the skin ? was this long slender figur her veri own ? what an astound differ cloth did make ! never befor had susan worn anyth near so fine . `` this is the way i ought to look all the time , '' thought she . `` and this is the way i _will_ look !

'' the bell rang . the excit die from susan 's face , leav it pale and cold . a wave of nausea swept through her . ellen peep out , mrs. tucker and miss hinkl listen with anxious face . `` it 's him ! '' whisper ellen , `` and there 's a taxi , too . '' it was decid that ellen should go to the door , that as she open it susan should come careless from the back room and advanc along the hall . and this program was carri out with the result that as gideon said , `` is miss sackvill here ? '' miss sackvill appear befor his widen , wonder , admir eye . he was dress in the extrem of fashion and costli in good tast ; while it would have been imposs for him to look distinguish , he did look what he was -- a prosper busi man with prospect . he came perfum and rustl . but he felt complet outclass -- until he remind himself that for all her brave show of fashion ladi she was onli a model while he was a fifteen-thousand-a-year man on the way to a partnership . `` do n't you think we might dine on the veranda at sherri 's ?

'' but he simpli could not abrupt break through the barrier ; he must squirm through gradual . `` that 's a swell outfit you ve got on , '' he began . `` yes , '' repli susan with her usual candor . `` miss hinkl borrow it out of the stock for me to wear . '' gideon was confus . he knew how she had got the hat and dress , but he expect her to make a pretens . he couldn't understand her not do it . such candor -- ani kind of candor -- was n't in the game of men and women as women had play it in his experi . the women -- all sort of women -- lie and fake at their busi just as men did in the busi of buy and sell good . and her voic -- and her way of speak -- they made him feel more than ever out of his class . he must get someth to drink as soon as it could be serv ; that would put him at his eas . yes -- a drink -- that would set him up again . and a drink for her -- that would bring her down from this queer new kind of high hors . `` i guess she must be a top notcher -- the real thing , come down in the world -- and not out of the near silk . but she ll be all right after a drink . one drink of liquor make the whole world kin . '' that last thought remind him of his own clever and he attack the situat afresh . but the convers as they drove up the avenu was on the whole constrain and intermitt -- chiefli about the weather . susan was observ -- and feel -- and enjoy . up bubbl her young spirit perpetu renew by her healthi , vital youth of bodi . she was see her belov citi of the sun again . as they turn out of the avenu for sherri 's main entranc susan realiz that she was in forty-fourth street . the street where she and spenser had live ! -- had live onli yesterday . no -- not yesterday -- imposs ! her eye close and she lean back in the cab . gideon was wait to help her alight . he saw that someth was wrong ; it stood out obvious in her ghast face . he fear the carriag men round the entranc would `` catch on '' to the fact that he was escort a girl so unus to swell surround that she was readi to faint with fright . `` don't be foolish , '' he said sharpli . susan reviv herself , descend , and with head bent low and trembl bodi enter the restaur . in the agit of get a tabl and settl at it gideon forgot for the moment her sick pallor . he began to order at onc , not consult her -- for he pride himself on his knowledg of cookeri and assum that she knew noth about it . `` have a cocktail ? '' ask he . `` yes , of cours you will . you need it bad and you need it quick . '' she said she prefer sherri . she had intend to drink noth , but she must have aid in conquer her faint and overwhelm depress . gideon took a dri martini ; order a second for himself when the first came , and had them both down befor she finish her sherri . `` i ve order champagn , '' said he . `` i suppos you like sweet champagn . most ladi do , but i ca n't stand see it serv even . '' `` no -- i like it veri dri , '' said susan . gideon glint his eye gayli at her , show his white jaguar teeth . `` so you re acquaint with fizz , are you ? '' he was feel his absurd notion of inequ in her favor dissip as the fume of the cocktail rose straight and strong from his empti stomach to his brain . `` do you know , i ve a sort of feel that we re go to like each other a lot . i think we make a handsom coupl -- eh -- what 's your first name ? '' `` lorna . '' `` lorna , then . my name 's ed , but everybodi call me gid . '' as soon as the melon was serv , he order the champagn open . `` to our better acquaint , '' said he , lift his glass toward her . `` thank you , '' said she , in a suffoc voic , touch her glass to her lip . he was too polit to speak , even in banter , of what he thought was the real caus of her polit and silenc . but he must end this state of overwhelmed at grand surround . said he : '' you re kind o ' shi , are n't you , lorna ? or is that your game ? '' `` i do n't know . you ve had a veri interest life , haven't you ? wo n't you tell me about it ? '' `` oh -- just ordinari , '' repli he , with a proper show of modesti . and straightway , as susan had hope , he launch into a minut account of himself -- the familiar stori of the energet , aggress man twist and kick his way up from two or three dollar a week . susan seem interest , but her mind refus to occupi itself with a narrat so commonplac . after rod and his friend this boast busi man was dull and tedious . whenev he laugh at an account of his superior craft -- how he had bluf this man , how he had eucher that one -- she smile . and so in one more case the common masculin delus that women listen to them on the subject of themselv , with interest and admir as profound as their own , was not impair . `` but , '' he wound up , `` i ve stay plain ed gideon . i never have let prosper swell _my_ head . and anyon that know me'll tell you i 'm a regular fool for generos with those that come at me right . . . . i ve alway been a favorit with the ladi .

'' while he had been talk on and on , susan had been appeal to the champagn to help her quiet her ach heart . she resolut set her thought to wander among the coupl at the other tabl in that subdu soften light -- the beauti dress women listen to their male companion with close attent -- were they too be bore by such trash by way of talk ? were they too simpli listen becaus it is the man who pay , becaus it is the man who must be concili and put in a good humor with himself , if dinner and dress and jewel are to be bought ? that tenement attic -- that hot moist workroom -- poverti -- privat -- '' honest work 's '' dread reward -- -- '' now , what kind of a man would you say i was ? '' gideon was inquir . `` how do you mean ?

'' susan listen with a smile that bare disturb the stolid calm of her featur . `` i 'm not go back , '' she said . mari hinkl was silenc by the quiet final of her voic . studi that delic face , she felt , behind it pallid impass , behind the refus to return , a reason she could not comprehend . she dim realiz that she would respect it if she could understand it ; for she suspect it had it origin somewher in susan 's `` refin ladylik natur . '' she knew that onc in a while among the women she was acquaint with there did happen one who prefer death in ani form of miseri to lead a lax life -- and indisput fact had convinc her that not alway were these women `` just stupid ignor fool . '' she herself possess no such refin of nerv or of whatev it was . she had been brought up in a loos famili and in a loos neighborhood . she was in the habit of make all sort of pretens , becaus that was the custom , while be candid about such matter was regard as bad form . she was not fool by these pretens in other girl , though they often did fool each other . in susan , she instinct felt , it was not pretens . it was someth or other els -- it was a danger realiti . she like susan ; in her intellig and physic charm were the possibl of get far up in the world ; it seem a piti that she was thus handicap . still , perhap susan would stumbl upon some worth while man who , attempt to possess her without marriag and fail , would pay the heavi price . there was alway that chanc -- a small chanc , smaller even than find by loos live a worth while man who would marri you becaus you happen exact to suit him -- to give him enough onli to make him feel that he want more . still , susan was unusu attract , and luck sometim did come a poor person 's way -- sometim . `` i 'm overdu back , '' said mari . `` you want me to tell em that ? '' `` yes . '' `` you ll have hard work find a job at anyth like as much as ten per . i ve got two trade , and i could n't at either one . '' `` i do n't expect to find it .

'' this indic of latent good sens reliev miss hinkl . `` i ll tell em you may be down tomorrow . think it over for anoth day . '' susan shook her head . `` they ll have to get somebodi els . '' and , as miss hinkl reach the threshold , `` wait till i do the dress up . you ll take it for me ? '' `` whi send the thing back ? '' urg mari . `` they belong to you . god know you earn em . '' susan , stand now , look down at the fineri . `` so i did . i ll keep them , '' said she . `` they 'd pawn for someth . '' `` with your look they 'd wear for a heap more . but keep em , anyhow . and i ll not tell jeffri you ve quit . it ll do no harm to hold your job open a day or so . '' `` as you like , '' said susan , to end the discuss . `` but i have quit . '' `` no matter . after you ve had someth to eat , you ll feel differ . '' and miss hinkl nod bright and depart . susan resum her seat at the bare wobbl littl tabl , resum her listless attitud . she did not move until ellen came in , hold out a note and say , `` a boy from your store brung this -- here . '' `` thank you , '' said susan , take the note . in it she found a twenty-dollar bill and a five . on the sheet of paper round it was scrawl : take the day off . here 's your commiss . we ll rais your pay in a few week , l. l. j . so mari hinkl had told them either that she was quit or that she was think of quit , and they wish her to stay , had use the mean they believ she could not resist . in a dreari way this amus her . as if she care whether or not life was kept in this worthless bodi of her , in her tire heart , in her disgust mind ! then she drop back into listless . when she was arous again it was by gideon , complet fill the small doorway . `` hello , my dear ! '' cri he cheer . `` mind my smoke ? '' susan slowli turn her head toward him , survey him with an express but one remov from the blank look she would have had if there had been no one befor her . `` i 'm feel fine today , '' pursu gideon , advanc a step and so bring himself about halfway to the tabl . `` had a coupl of pick-me-up and a fat breakfast . how are you ? '' `` i 'm alway well . '' `` thought you seem a littl seedi . '' his shrewd sensual eye were explor the open in her nightdress . `` you ll be mighti glad to get out of this hole . gosh ! it 's hot . don't see how you stand it . i 'm a law abid citizen but i must say i 'd turn crimin befor i 'd put up with this . '' in the underworld from which gideon had sprung -- the underworld where welter the overwhelm mass of the human race -- there are three main type . there are the hopeless and spiritless -- the mass -- who welter passiv on , breed and die . there are the spirit who also possess both shrewd and calcul ; they push upward by hook and by crook , alway mind of the futil of the struggl of the petti crimin of the slum against the polic and the law ; they arriv and found the aristocraci of the futur . the third is the crimin class . it is also made up of the spirit -- but the spirit who , have littl shrewd and no calcul -- that is , no abil to forese and measur consequ -- wage clumsi war upon societi and pay the penalti of their fatuiti in live of wretched even more wretch than the common lot . gideon belong to the second class -- the class that push upward without get into jail ; he was a fair repres of this type , neither it best nor it worst , but about midway of it rang between arrog , all-domin plutocrat and shyster merchant or lawyer or politician who bare escap the crimin class . `` you do n't ask me to sit down , deari , '' he went on faceti . `` but i 'm not so mad that i wo n't do it . '' he took the seat miss hinkl had clear on the bed . his glanc wander disgust from object to object in the crowd yet bare attic . he caught a whiff of the odor from across the hall -- from the fresh-air shaft -- and hastili gave sever puff at his cigar to satur his surround with it perfum . susan act as if she were alon in the room . she had not even drawn togeth her nightgown . `` i phone your store about you , '' resum gideon . `` they said you had n't show up -- would n't till tomorrow . so i came round here and your landladi sent me up . i want to take you for a drive this afternoon . we can dine up to claremont or farther , if you like . '' `` no , thank , '' said susan . `` i ca n't go . '' `` upty-tupti ! '' cri gideon . `` what 's the ladi so sour about ? '' `` i 'm not sour . '' `` then whi wo n't you go ? '' `` i ca n't . '' `` but we ll have a chanc to talk over what i 'm go to do for you . '' `` you ve kept your word , '' said susan . `` that was onli part . besid , i 'd have given your hous the order , anyhow . '' susan 's eye sudden light up . `` you would ? '' she cri . `` well -- a part of it . not so much , of cours . but i never let pleasur interfer with busi . nobodi that doe ever get veri far . '' her express made him hasten to explain -- without be conscious whi . `` i said -- _part_ of the order , my dear . they owe to you about half of what they ll make off me . . . . what that money on the tabl ? your commiss ? '' `` yes . '' `` twenty-f ? um ! '' gideon laugh . `` well , i suppos it 's as generous as i 'd be , in the same circumst . encourag your employe , but do n't swell-head em -- that 's the good rule . i'v seen mani a promis young chap ruin by a rais of pay . . . . now , about you and me . '' gideon took a roll of bill from his trouser pocket , count off five twenti , toss them on the tabl . `` there ! '' one of the bill in fall touch susan 's hand . she jerk the hand away as if the bill had been afir . she took all five of them , fold them , held them out to him . `` the hous has paid me , '' said she . `` that 's honest , '' said he , nod approv . `` i like it . but in your case it do n't appli . '' these two , thus face a practic situat , reveal an import , overlook truth about human moral . human divid broad into three class : the arriv ; those who will never arriv and will never tri ; those in a state of flux , attempt and either fail or succeed . the arriv and the inert togeth preach and to a certain extent practic an idealist system of moral that interfer with them in no way . it doe not interfer with the arriv becaus they have no need to infring it , except for amus ; it doe not interfer with the inert , but rather help them to bear their lot by give them a cheer notion that their insignific is due to their good . this idealist system receiv the homag of lip servic from the third and struggl section of mankind , but no more , for in practic it would hamper them at everi turn in their effort to fight their way up . susan was , at that stage of her career , a candid for membership in the struggl class . her heart was set firm against the unwritten , unspoken , even unwhisp code of practic moral which domin the struggl class . but life had at least taught her the folli of intoler . so when gideon talk in term of that practic moral , she listen without offens ; and she talk to him in term of it becaus to talk the idealist moral in which she had been bred and befor which she bow the knee in sincer belief would have been simpli to excit his laughter at her innoc and his contempt for her folli . `` i feel that i ve been paid , '' said she . `` i did it for the hous -- becaus i owe it to them . '' `` onli for the hous ? '' said he with insinu tender . he took and press the finger extend with the money in them . `` onli for the hous , '' she repeat , a hard note in her voic . and her finger slip away , leav the money in his hand . `` at least , i suppos it must have been for the hous , '' she ad , reflect , talk to herself aloud . `` whi did i do it ? i do n't know . i do n't know . they say one alway has a reason for what one doe . but i often ca n't find ani reason for thing i do -- that , for instanc . i simpli did it becaus it seem to me not to matter much what _i_ did with myself , and they want the order so bad . '' then she happen to becom conscious of his presenc and to see a look of uneasi , self-complac , as if he were think that he quit understood this puzzl . she disconcert him with what vain men call a cruel snub . `` but whatev the reason , it certain could n't have been you , '' said she . `` now , look here , lorna , '' protest gideon , the begin of anger in his tone . `` that 's not the way to talk if you want to get on . '' she eye him with an express which would have rais a suspicion that he was repuls in a man less self-confid , less indiffer to what the human be he use for pleasur or profit thought of him . `` to say noth of what i can do for you , there 's the matter of futur order . i order twice a year -- in big lot alway . '' `` i ve quit down there . '' `` oh ! somebodi els has given you someth good -- eh ? _that's_ whi you re cocki . '' `` no . '' `` then whi ve you quit ? '' `` i wish you could tell me . i do n't understand . but -- i ve done it . '' gideon puzzl with this a moment , decid that it was beyond him and unimport , anyhow . he blew out a cloud of smoke , stretch his leg and took up the main subject . `` i was about to say , i ve got a place for you . i 'd like to take you to chicago , but there 's a mrs. g. -- as dear , sweet , good a soul as ever live -- just what a man want at home with the children and to make thing respect . i would n't griev her for world . but i ca n't live without a littl fun -- and mrs. g. is a bit slow for me . . . . still , it 's no use talk about have you out there . she ought to be abl to understand that an activ man need two women . one for the quiet side of his natur , the other for the live side . sometim i think she -- like a lot of wive -- would n't object if it was n't that she was afraid the other ladi would get me away altogeth and she 'd be left strand . '' `` natur , '' said susan . `` not at all ! '' cri he . `` do n't you get ani such notion in that love littl head of your , my dear . you women don't understand honor -- a man 's sens of honor . '' `` natur , '' repeat susan . he gave a glanc of short disapprov . her voic was not to his like . `` let 's drop mrs. g. out of this , '' said he . `` as i was say , i ve arrang for you to take a place here -- easi work -- someth to occupi you -- and i ll foot the bill over and abov -- -- '' he stop short or , rather , was stop by the peculiar smile susan had turn upon him . befor it he slowli redden , and his eye reluct shift . he had rous her from listless , from indiffer . the poison in her blood were burn up by the fresh , swift flow current set in motion by his word , by the help of his express , of his presenc . she becam again the intens healthi , therefor intens aliv , therefor energet and undaunt susan lenox , who , when still a child , had not hesit to fli from home , from everyon she knew , into an unknown world . `` what are you smile at me that way for ? '' demand he in a tone of extrem irrit . `` so you look on me as your mistress ? '' and never in all her life had her eye been so gray -- the gray of cruelest ironi . `` now what 's the use discuss those thing ? you know the world . you re a sensibl woman . '' susan made closer and more secur the larg loos coil of her hair , rose and lean against the tabl . `` you don't understand . you could n't . i 'm not one of those respect women , like your mrs. g. , who belong to men . and i 'm not one of the other kind who also throw in their soul with their bodi for good measur . do _you_ think you had _me ? _ '' she laugh with madden gentl mockeri , went on : `` i do n't hate you . i do n't despis you even . you mean well . but the sight of you make me sick . it make me feel as i do when i think of a dirti tenement i use to have to live in , and of the thing that i use to have to let crawl over me . so i want to forget you as soon as i can -- and that will be soon after you get out of my sight . '' her blaze eye startl him . her voic , not lift abov it usual quiet tone , enrag him . `` you -- you ! '' he cri . `` you must be crazi , to talk to _me_ like that ! '' she nod . `` yes -- crazi , '' said she with the same quiet intens . `` for i know what kind of a beast you are -- a clean , good-natur beast , but still a beast . and how could you understand ? '' he had got upon his feet . he look as if he were go to strike her . she made a slight gestur toward the door . he felt at a hopeless disadvantag with her -- with this woman who did not rais her voic , did not need to rais it to express the uttermost of ani passion . his jag teeth gleam through his mustach ; his shrewd littl eye snap like an angri rat 's . he fumbl about through the steam of his insan rage for adequ insult -- in vain . he rush from the room and bolt downstair . within an hour susan was out , look for work . there could be no turn back now . until she went with gideon it had been as if her dead were still unburi and in the hous . now -- -- never again could she even indulg in dream of go to rod . that part of her life was finish with all the final of the close grave . grief -- yes . but the same sort of grief as when a love one , after a long and pain ill , find relief in death . her love for rod had been stricken of a mortal ill the night of their arriv in new york . after linger for a year between life and death , after a long death agoni , it had expir . the end came -- these matter of the exact moment of inevit event are unimport but have a certain melancholi interest -- the end came when she made choic where there was no choic , in the cab with gideon . for better or for wors she was free . she was readi to begin her career . chapter iv after a few day , when she was view her situat in a calmer , more normal mood with the practic feminin eye , she regret that she had refus gideon 's money . she was proud of that within herself which had impel and compel her to refus it ; but she wish she had it . take it , she felt , would have ad noth to her humili in her own sight ; and for what he thought of her , one way or the other , she care not a pin . it is one of the familiar curios of human inconsist which is at bottom so complet consist , that she did not regret have refus his far more valuabl offer to aid her . she did not regret even dure those few next day of dishearten search for work . we often read how purpos can be so power that it compel . no doubt if susan 's purpos had been to get temporari relief -- or , perhap , had it been to get perman relief by weav a sex spell -- she would in that desper mood have been abl to compel . unfortun she was not seek to be a pauper or a parasit ; she was tri to find steadi employ at live wage -- that is , at wage abov the market valu for femal and for most male -- labor . and that sort of purpos can not compel . our civil overflow with chariti -- which is simpli willing to hand back to labor as generous gracious alm a small part of the loot from the just wage of labor . but of real help -- just wage for honest labor -- there is littl , for real help would disarrang the system , would abolish the upper class . she had some faint hope in the direct of millineri and dressmak , the thing for which she felt she had distinct talent . she was soon disabus . there was noth for her , and could be noth until after sever year of doubt apprenticeship in the trade to which ani femal person seek employ to piec out an incom instinct turn first and offer herself at the employ 's own price . day after day , from the first moment of the industri day until it end , she hunt -- wearili , yet unweari -- with resolv live on after the death of hope . she answer advertis ; despit the obvious sensibl warn of the work girl she talk with she even consult and took list from the religi and charit organ , patron by those whose enthusiasm about honest work had never been cool by do or tri to do ani of it , and manag by those who , begin as worker , had made all hast to escap from it into posit where they could live by talk about it and lie about it -- say the thing comfort peopl subscrib to philanthropi to hear . there was work , plenti of it . but not at decent wage , and not lead to wage that could be earn without vicious wrong those under her in an execut posit . but even in those case the prospect of promot was vagu and remot , with ill and fail strength and poor food , wors cloth and lodg , as certainti straightway . at some place she was refus with the first glanc at her . no good-look girl want ; even though they behav themselv and attract custom , the custom lost sight of matter of merchandis in the all-absorb matter of sex . in offic a good-look girl upset disciplin , caus the place to degener into a deer-haunt in the mate season . no place did she find offer more than four dollar a week , except where the dress requir made the nomin higher wage even less . everywher women 's wage were base upon the assumpt that women either live at home or made the princip part of their incom by prostitut , disguis or frank . in fact , all wage even the wage of men except in a few trade -- were too small for an independ support . there had to be a famili -- and the whole famili had to work -- and even then the joint incom was not enough for decenc . she had no famili or friend to help her -- at least , no friend except those as poor as herself , and she could not commit the crime of ad to their miseri . she had less than ten dollar left . she must get to work at onc -- and what she earn must suppli her with all . a note came from jeffri -- a curt request that she call -- curt to disguis the eager to have her back . she tore it up . she did not even debat the matter . it was one of her signific qualiti that she never had the inclin , appar lack the power , to turn back onc she had turn away . mari hinkl came , urg her . susan listen in silenc , mere shook her head for answer , chang the subject . in the entranc to the loft of a tall broadway build she saw a placard : `` experienc hand at fanci ready-to-wear hat trim want . '' she climb three steep flight and was in a larg , low-ceiling room where perhap seventy-f girl were at work . she paus in the doorway long enough to observ the kind of work -- a pure mechan process of stitch a few trim in exact the same way upon a cheap hat frame . then she went to an open window in a glass partit and ask employ of a young jew with an incred long nose thrust from the midst of a pimpli face which seem mere it too small base . `` experienc ? '' ask the young man . `` i can do what those girl are do . '' with intellig eye he glanc at her face , then let his glanc rove contemptu over the room full of worker . `` i should hope so , '' said he . `` forti cent a dozen . want to tri it ?

'' susan sign her name to what she saw at a glanc was some sort of contract . she knew it contain noth to her advantag , much to her disadvantag . but she did not care . she had to have work -- someth , anyth that would stop the wast of her slender capit . and within fifteen minut she was seat in the midst of the sweat , almost nauseat odor women of all age , was toil away at the simpl task of make an ugli hat frame still more ugli by the addit of a bit of tawdri cotton ribbon , a buckl , and a bunch of absurd artifici flower . she was soon abl to calcul rough what she could make in six day . she thought she could do two dozen of the hat a day ; and twelv dozen hat at forti cent the dozen would mean four dollar and eighti cent a week ! four dollar and eighti cent ! less than she had plan to set asid for food alon , out of her ten dollar as a model . next her on the right sat a middle-ag woman , grossli fat , repuls shapeless , piteous home -- one of those luckless human be who are foredoom from the outset never to know ani of the great joy of life the joy that come through our power to attract our fellow-b . as this woman stitch away , squint through the steel-fram spectacl set upon her snub nose , susan saw that she had not even good health to mitig her lot , for her color was pasti and on her dirti skin lay blotch of dull red . except a veri young girl here and there all the women had poor or bad skin . and susan was not made disdain by the odor which is far wors than that of ani lower anim , howev dirti , becaus the human anim must wear cloth . she had live in wretched in a tenement ; she knew that this odor was an inevit part of tenement life when one has neither the time nor the mean to be clean . poor food , foul air , broken sleep -- bad health , diseas , unsight face , repuls bodi ! no wonder the common peopl look almost like anoth race in contrast with their brother and sister of the comfort class . anoth race ! the race into which she would soon be reborn under the black magic of poverti ! as she glanc and reflect on what she saw , view it in the light of her experi , her finger slacken , and she could speed them up onli in spurt . `` if i stay here , '' thought she , `` in a few week i shall be like these other . no matter how hard i may fight , i ll be drag down . '' as imposs to escap the common lot as for a swimmer alon in mid-ocean to keep up indefinit whether long or brief , the struggl could have but , the one end -- to be sunk in , merg in , the ocean . it took no great amount of vaniti for her to realiz that she was in everi way the superior of all those around her -- in everi way except one . what did she lack ? whi was it that with her superior intellig , her superior skill both of mind and of bodi , she could be thus drag down and held far below her natur level ? whi could she not lift herself up among the sort of peopl with whom she belong -- or even make a begin toward lift herself up ? whi could she not take hold ? what did she lack ? what must she acquir -- or what get rid of ? at lunch time she walk with the ugli woman up and down the first side street abov the build in which the factori was locat . she ate a roll she bought from a pushcart man , the woman munch an appl with her few remnant of teeth . `` most of the girl is alway kick , '' said the woman . `` but i'm mighti satisfi . i get enough to eat and to wear , and i'v got a bed to sleep in -- and what els is there in life for anybodi , rich or poor ?

'' still , she did not regret . of all the horror the most repel seem to her to be depend upon some one man who could take it away at his whim . she disregard the advic of the other girl and made the round of the religi and charit home for work girl . she believ she could endur perhap better than could girl with more fals pride , with more awe of snobbish convent -- at least she could tri to endur -- the supercili , the patron air , the petti restraint and oppress , the nauseat smug , the constant pri and peep , the hypocrit lectur , the heavi dose of smug moral . she felt that she could bear with almost ani annoy and humili to be in clean surround and to get food that was at least not so rotten that the eye could see it and the nose smell it . but she found all the home full , with long wait list , fill for the most part , so the work girl said , with profession object of chariti . thus she had no opportun to judg for herself whether there was ani truth in the prejudic of the girl against these few and feebl attempt to mitig the miseri of a vast and ever vaster multitud of girl . ad togeth all the accommod offer by all the home of everi descript , there was a total that might possibl have provid for the homeless girl of a dozen factori or sweatshop -- and the number of homeless girl was more than a quarter of a million , was increas at the rate of more than a hundr a day . chariti is so trifl a forc that it can , and should be , disregard . it serv no _good_ use servic . it enabl comfort peopl to delud themselv that all that can be done is be done to mitig the misfortun which the poor bring upon themselv . it obscur the truth that modern civil has been pervert into a huge manufactur of decrepitud and diseas , of poverti and prostitut . the reason we talk so much and listen so eager when our magnific benevol are the subject is that we do not wish to be disturb -- and that we dear love the tickl sensat in our vaniti of generos . susan was compel to the common lot -- the lot that will be the common lot as long as there are peopl to be made , by take advantag of human necess , to forc men and women and children to degrad themselv into machin as wage-slav . at two dollar a week , doubl what her incom justifi -- she rent a room in a tenement flat in bleecker street . it was a closet of a room whose thin , dirt-adorn wall were no protect against sound or vermin , not give even privaci from pri eye . she might have done a littl better had she been will to share room and bed with one or more girl , but not enough better to compens for what that would have meant . the young jew with the nose so imposs that it elev his counten from commonplac ugli to weird distinct had taken a friend fanci to her . he was julius bam , nephew of the proprietor . in her third week he offer her the forewoman 's place . `` you ve got a few brain in your head , '' said he . `` miss tuohi 's a boob . take the job and you ll push up . we ll start you at five per .

'' susan kept say to herself . the phrase was alway echo in her brain . but how ? -- _how ? _ and to that question she could find no answer . everi morn she bought a one-c paper whose big circul was in larg part due to it want ad -- it daili section of close print column of advertis of help want and situat want . susan read the column dilig . at first they act upon her like an intoxic , fill her not mere with hope but with confid belief that soon she would be in a situat where the pay was good and the work agreeabl , or at least not disagre . but after a few week she ceas from read . whi ? becaus she answer the advertis , score of them , more than a hundr , befor she saw through the trick and gave up . she found that throughout new york all the attract or even toler place were fill by girl help by their famili or in other way , girl work at less than live wage becaus they did not have to reli upon their wage for their support . and those help want advertis were simpli appeal for more girl of that sort -- for cheaper girl ; or they were insert by employ agenc , masquerad in the newspap as employ and lie in wait to swindl work girl by get a fee in exchang for a fals promis of good work at high wage ; or they were the net flung out by crafti employ who speed and starv their slave , and wish to recruit fresh relay to replac those that had quit in exhaust or in despair . `` whi do you alway read the want ad ? '' she said to lani ricardo , who spent all her spare time at those advertis in two paper she bought and one she borrow everi day . `` did you ever get anyth good , or hear of anybodi that did ? '' `` oh , my , no , '' repli lani with a laugh . `` i read for the same reason that all the rest do . it 's a kind of dope . you read and then you dream about the place -- how grand they are and how well off you ll be . but nobodi 'd be fool enough to answer one of em unless she was out of a job and had to get anoth and did n't care how rotten it was . no , it 's just dope -- like buyin polici number or lotteri ticket . you know you wo n't git a prize , but you have a lot of fun dream about it . '' as susan walk up and down at the lunch hour , she talk with worker , both men and women , in all sort of employ . some were do a littl better than she ; other -- the most -- were wors off chiefli becaus her educ , her develop intellig , enabl her to ward off savag blow -- such as ill from rotten food -- against which their ignor made them defenseless . whenev she heard a stori of someon get on , how grotesqu differ it was from the stori she use to get out of the sunday school librari and dream over ! these almost actual of get on had noth in them about honesti and virtu . accord to them it was alway some sort of mean or trickeri ; and the particular mean or trick were , in these practic school of success in session at each lunch hour , relat in detail as lesson in how to get on . if the success under discuss was a woman 's , it was alway how her boss or employ had `` got stuck on her '' and had given her an easier job with good pay so that she could wear cloth more agreeabl to his eye and to his touch . now and then it was a wonder dazzl success -- some girl had got her rich employ so `` dead crazi '' about her that he had taken her away from work altogeth and had set her up in a flat with a servant and a `` swell trap '' ; there was even talk of marriag . was it true ? were the sunday school book through and through lie -- ridicul , mislead lie , wick lie -- wick becaus they hid the shame truth that ought to be proclaim from the housetop ? susan was not sure . perhap envi twist somewhat these tale of rare occasion success told by the worker to each other . but certain it was that , wherev she had the opportun to see for herself , success came onli by hard of heart , by trick and cheat . certain it was also that the general belief among the worker was that success could be got in those way onli -- and this belief made the falsehood , if it was a falsehood , or the partial truth , if it was a twist truth , full as poison as if it had been true throughout . also , if the thing were not true , how came it that everyon in practic life believ it to be so -- how came it that everyon who talk in prais of honesti and virtu look , as he talk , as if he were cant and half expect to be laugh at ? all about her as bad off as she , or wors off . yet none so unhappi as she -- not even the wors off . in fact , the wors off as the better off were not so deepli wretch . becaus they had never in all their live known the decenc of life clean lodg , clean cloth , food fit to eat , leisur and the mean of enjoy leisur . and susan had known all these thing . when she realiz whi her companion in miseri , so feebl in self-restraint , were abl to endur patient and for the most part even cheer , how care she was never to say or to suggest anyth that might put idea of what life might be , of what it was for the comfort few , into the mind of these girl who never had known and could onli be made wretch by know ! how fortun for them , she thought , that they had gone to school where they met onli their own kind ! how fortun that the devour monster of industri had snatch them away from school befor their mind had been awaken to the realiti of life ! how fortun that their imagin were too dull and too heavi to be touch by the sight of luxuri they saw in the street or by what they read in the newspap and in the cheap novel ! to them , as she soon realiz , their world seem the onli world , and the world that live in comfort seem a vagu unreal , as must seem whatev doe not come into our own experi . one lunch hour an apostl of discont preach some kind of polit or other held forth on the corner abov the shop . susan paus to listen . she had heard onli a few word when she was incens to the depth of her heart against him . he ought to be stop by the polic , this scoundrel tri to make these peopl unhappi by awaken them to the miseri and degrad of their lot ! he look like an honest , earnest man . no doubt he fanci that he was in some way do good . these peopl who were alway tri to do the poor good -- they ought all to be suppress ! if someon could tell them how to ceas to be poor , that would inde be good . but such a thing would be imposs . in sutherland , where the best off hadn't so pain much more than the worst off , and where everybodi but the idl and the drunken , and even they most of the time , had enough to eat , and a decent place to sleep , and some kind of sunday cloth -- in sutherland the poverti was less than in cincinnati , infinit less than in this vast and incred rich new york where in certain district wealth , enorm wealth , was pile up and up . so evid the presenc of rich did not help poverti but seem to increas it . no , the diseas was miser , thought susan . for most of the human race , diseas and bad food and vile bed in dingi hole and day of fierc , poor paid toil -- that was the law of this hell of a world . and to escap from that hideous tyranni , you must be hard , you must trampl , you must rob , you must ceas to be human . the apostl of discont insist that the law could be chang , that the tyranni could be abolish . she listen , but he did not convinc her . he sound vagu and dreami -- as fantast fals in his new way as she had found the sunday school book to be . she pass on . she continu to pay out a cent each day for the newspap . she no longer bother with the want ad . pipe dream did not attract her ; she was too fierc bent upon escap , actual escap , to wast time in dream of way of escap that she never could realiz . she read the paper becaus , if she could not live in the world but was batter down in it dark and foul and crowd cellar , she at least wish to know what was go on up in the light and air . she found everi day news of great do , of wonder rise , of rich reward for industri and thrift , of abound prosper and of opportun fair forc itself into accept . but all this appli onli to the few so strang and so luckili chosen , while the mass was reject . for that mass , from earliest childhood until death , there was onli toil in squalor -- squalid food , squalid cloth , squalid shelter . and when she read one day -- in an obscur paragraph in her newspap -- that the incom of the averag american famili was less than twelv dollar a week -- less than two dollar and a half a week for each individu -- she realiz that what she was see and live was not new york and cincinnati , but was the common lot , countri wide , no doubt world wide . `` _must_ take hold !

'' susan persuad miss tuohi to take mrs. tucker on . she could truth recommend the old woman as a hard worker . they move into a room in a tenement in south fifth avenu . susan read in the paper about a model tenement and went to tri for what was describ as real luxuri in comfort and cleanli . she found that sort of tenement fill with middle-class famili on their way down in the world and make their last stand against rise rent and rise price . the model tenement rent were far , far beyond her abil to pay . she might as well think of move to the waldorf . she and mrs. tucker had to be content with a dark room on the fifth floor , open on a damp air shaft whose odor was so foul that in comparison the clinton place shaft was as the pure breath of the open sky . for this shelter -- more than one-half the free and proud citizen of prosper america dwell in citi occupi it like , or wors they paid three dollar a week -- a dollar and a half apiec . they wash their undercloth at night , slept while it was dri . and susan , who could not bring herself to imit the other girl and wear a blous of dark color that was not to be wash , rose at four to do the necessari iron . they did their own cook . it was no longer possibl for susan to buy qualiti and content herself with small quantiti . howev small the quantiti of food she could get along on , it must be of poor qualiti -- for good qualiti was beyond her mean . it madden her to see the better class of work girl . their fair good cloth , their evid of some comfort at home , seem to mock at her as a poor fool who was be beaten down becaus she had not wit enough to get on . she knew these girl were either support themselv in part by prostitut or were held up by their famili , by the pool of the earn of sever person . left to themselv , to their own earn at work , they would be no better off than she , or at best so littl better off that the differ was unimport . if to live decent in new york took an incom of fifteen dollar a week , what did it matter whether one got five or ten or twelv ? ani wage below fifteen meant a steadi downward drag -- meant exposur to the dirt and poison of poverti tenement -- meant the steadi declin of the power of resist , the steadi ooz away of self-respect , of the courag and hope that give the power to rise . to have less than the fifteen dollar absolut necessari for decent surround , decent cloth , decent food -- that meant one was drown . what matter whether the death of the soul was quick , or slow , whether the water of destruct were twenti feet deep or twenti thousand ? mrs. reardon , the servant woman on the top floor , was evict and susan and mrs. tucker took her in . she protest that she could sleep on the floor , that she had done so a larg part of her life -- that she prefer it to most bed . but susan made her up a kind of bed in the corner . they would not let her pay anyth . she had rheumat horribl , some kind of lung troubl , and the almost univers and repuls catarrh that prey upon work peopl . her hair had dwindl to a meager wisp . this she wound into a hard littl knot and fasten with an imit tortoise-shel comb , huge , high , and broken , set with larg piec of glass cut like diamond . her teeth were all gone and her cheek almost met in her mouth . one day , when mrs. tucker and mrs. reardon were exchang eulog upon the good of god to them , susan shock them by harsh order them to be silent . `` if god hear you , '' she said , `` he ll think you re mock him . anyhow , i ca n't stand ani more of it . hereaft do your talk of that kind when i 'm not here . '' anoth day mrs. reardon told about her sister . the sister had work in a factori where some sort of poison that had a rot effect on the human bodi was use in the manufactur . like a seri of other the sister caught the diseas . but instead of rot out a spot , a few finger , or part of the face , it had eaten away the whole of her lower jaw so that she had to prepar her food for swallow by first press it with her finger against her upper teeth . use as susan was to hear horror in this region where diseas and accid prey upon everi famili , she fled from the room and walk shudder about the street -- the street with their incess march past of blight and blast , of maim and crippl and worm-eaten . until that day susan had been about as unobserv of the obvious thing as is the rest of the race . on that day she for the first time notic the crowd in the street , with mind alert to sign of the ravag of accid and diseas . hard a sound bodi , hard one that was not piteous and hideous mark . when she return -- and she did not stay out long -- mrs. tucker was alon . said she : '' mrs. reardon say the rotten jaw was sent on her sister as a punish for marri a protest , she be a cathol . how ignor some peopl is ! of cours , the good lord sent the judgment on her for be a cathol at all . '' `` mrs. tucker , '' said susan , `` did you ever hear of nero ? '' `` he burn up rome -- and he burn up the christian martyr , '' said mrs. tucker . `` i had a good school . besid , sermon is high educ . '' `` well , '' said susan , `` if i had a choic of live under nero or of live under that god you and mrs. reardon talk about , i'd take nero and be thank and happi . '' mrs. tucker would have fled if she could have afford it . as it was all she ventur was a sigh and lip move in prayer . on a friday in late octob , at the lunch hour , susan was walk up and down the sunni side of broadway . it was the first distinct cool day of the autumn ; there had been a heavi downpour of rain all morn , but the new york sun that is ever struggl to shine and is success on all but an occasion day was tear up and scatter the cloud with the aid of a sharp north wind blow down the deep canyon . she was wear her summer dress still -- old and dingi but clean . that look of neat about the feet -- that charm of a well-shap foot and a well-turn ankl proper set off -- had disappear -- with her the surest sign of the extrem of desper poverti . her shoe were much scuf , were even slight down at the heel ; her sailor hat would have look onli the wors had it had a fresh ribbon on it crown . this first hint of winter had stung her fast numb faculti into unusu activ . she was rememb the miseri of the cold in cincinnati -- the miseri that had driven her into prostitut as a drunken driver lash make the frenzi hors rush he care not where in his desir to escap . this wind of broadway -- this first warn of winter -- it was hiss in her ear : `` take hold ! winter is come ! take hold ! '' summer and winter -- fieri heat and brutal cold . like the devil in the poem , the poor -- the mass , all but a few of the human race -- were hurri from fire to ice , to vari their torment and to make it alway exquisit . to shelter herself for a moment she paus at a spot that happen to be protect to the south by a project sidewalk sign . she was face , with onli a tantal sheet of glass between , a display of winter undercloth on wax figur . to show them off more effect the side and the back of the window were mirror . susan 's gaze travel past the figur to a person she saw stand at full length befor her . `` who is that pale , stoop girl ? '' she thought . `` how dreari and sad she look ! how hard she is fight to make her cloth look decent , when they are n't ! she must be someth like me -- onli much wors off . '' and then she realiz that she was gaze at her own imag , was piti her own self . the room she and mrs. tucker and the old scrubwoman occupi was so dark , even with it one littl gas jet light , that she was abl to get onli a faint look at herself in the littl crack and water-mark mirror over it filthi washstand -- filthi becaus the dirt was so ground in that onli flood of water and bar of soap could have clean down to it origin surfac . she was have a clear look at herself for the first time in three month . she shrank in horror , yet gaze on fascin . whi , her physic charm had gone gone , leav hard a trace ! those dull , hollow eye -- that thin and almost ghast face -- the emaci form -- the onc attract hair now look poor and stringi becaus it could not be wash proper -- abov all , the sad , bitter express about the mouth . those pale lip ! her lip had been from childhood one of her conspicu and most tempt beauti ; and as the sex side of her natur had develop they had bloom into wonder fresh and vivid of form and color . now -- -- those pale , pale lip ! they seem to form a sort of climax of tragedi to the melancholi of her face . she gaze on and on . she note everi detail . how she had fallen ! inde , a fallen woman ! these other had been born to the condit that were destroy her ; they were no wors off , in mani case better off . but she , born to comfort and custom of intellig educ associ and associ -- -- a fallen woman ! honest work ! even if it were true that this honest work was a sort of probat through which one rose to better thing -- even if this were true , could it be deni that onli a few at best could rise , that the most -- includ all the sensit , and most of the children -- must wallow on , must perish ? oh , the lie , the lie about honest work ! rosa mohr , a girl of her own age who work in the same room , join her . `` admir yourself ? '' she said laugh . `` well , i do n't blame you . you _are_ pretti . '' susan at first thought rosa was mock her . but the tone and express were sincer . `` it wo n't last long , '' rosa went on . `` i was n't so bad myself when i quit the high school and took a job becaus father lost his busi and his health . he got in the way of one of those trust . so of cours they hand it to him good and hard . but he was n't a squealer . he alway said they 'd done onli what he 'd been do himself if he 'd had the chanc . i alway think of what papa use to say when i hear peopl carri on about how wick this or that somebodi els is .

'' she watch susan 's fine sympathet face , and in a burst of confid said : `` one night the landladi sent me up with seventeen men . and she kept the seventeen dollar i made , and took away from me half a dollar one drunken longshoreman gave me as a present . she said i owe it for board and cloth . in those hous , high and low , the girl alway owe the madam . they have n't a stitch of their own to their back . '' the two girl stood face each other , each look past the other into the wind-swept canyon of broadway -- the majest vista of lofti build , symbol of wealth and luxuri so abund that it flaunt itself , overflow in gaudi extravag . final susan said : '' do you ever think of kill yourself ? '' `` i thought i would , '' repli the other girl . `` but i guess i would n't have . everybodi know there 's no hope , yet they keep on hopin ' . and i ve got pretti good health yet , and onc in a while i have some fun . you ought to go to danc -- and drink . you would n't be blue _all_ the time , then . '' `` if it was n't for the sun , '' said susan . `` the sun ? '' inquir rosa . `` where i came from , '' explain susan , `` it rain a great deal , and the sky was cover so much of the time . but here in new york there is so much sun . i love the sun . i get desper -- then out come the sun , and i say to myself , well , i guess i can go on a while longer , with the sun to help me . ' '' `` i had n't thought of it , '' said rosa , `` but the sun is a help . '' that indefatig new york sun ! it was like susan 's own courag . it fought the cloud whenev cloud dare to appear and contest it right to shine upon the citi of the sun , and hard a day was so stormi that for a moment at least the sun did not burst through for a look at it belov . for week susan had eaten almost noth . dure her previous sojourn in the slum -- the slum of cincinnati , though they were not class as slum -- the food had seem revolt . but she was less discrimin then . the onli food she could afford now -- the food that is the best obtain for a major of the inhabit of ani citi -- was simpli imposs for her . she ate onli when she could endur no longer . this starvat no doubt save her from ill ; but at the same time it drain her strength . her vital had been go down , a littl each day -- lower and lower . the poverti which had infuri her at first was now act upon her like a sooth poison . the reason she had not risen to revolt was this slow and subtl poison that explain the inertia of the tenement poor from babyhood . to be spirit one must have health or a nervous system diseas in some of the way that caus constant irrit . the diseas call poverti is not an irrit , but an anesthet . if susan had been born to that life , her natur vivaci tempera would have made her gay in unconsci wretched ; as it was , she knew her own miseri and suffer from it keen -- at time hideous -- yet was rapid lose the power to revolt . perhap it was the wind -- yes , it must have been the wind with it threat of winter -- that rous her sluggish blood , that whip thought into action . anyth -- anyth would be right , if it promis escap . right -- wrong ! hypocrit word for comfort peopl ! that friday night , after her supper of half-cook corn meal and tea , she went instant to work at wash out cloth . mrs. tucker spent the even gossip with the janitress , came in about midnight . as usual she was full to the brim with news of miseri -- of job lost , abandon wive , of abus children , of poison from rotten `` fresh '' food or from '' embalm '' stuff in can , of sick and yet more sick , of maim accid , of death -- news that is the commonplac of tenement life . she love to tell these tale with all the harrow particular and to find in each some evid of the good of god to herself . often susan could let her run on and on without listen . but not that night . she resist the impuls to bid her be silent , left the room and stood at the hall window . when she return mrs. tucker was in bed , was snore in a tranquil that was the revers of contagi . with her habitu cheer she had adapt herself to her chang condit without fret . she had becom as rag and as dirti as her neighbor ; she so wrought upon susan sensibl , blunt though they were , that the girl would have been unabl to sleep in the same bed if she had not alway been tire to exhaust when she lay down . but for that matter onli exhaust could have kept her asleep in that vermin-infest hole . even the fiercest swarm of the insect that flew or ran or crawl and bit , even the filthi mice squeak as they play upon the cover or ran over the face of the sleeper , did not often rous her . while mrs. tucker snore , susan work on , get everi piec of at all fit cloth in her meager wardrob into the best possibl condit . she did not onc glanc at the face of the noisi sleeper -- a face home enough in mrs. tucker 's wake hour , hideous now with the mouth open and a few scatter rotten teeth expos , and the dark yellow-blu of the unhealthi gum and tongu . at dawn mrs. tucker awok with a snort and a start . she rub her eye with her dirti and twist and wrinkl finger -- the nail were worn and broken , turn up as if warp at the edg , blacken with dirt and bruis . `` whi , are you up alreadi ? '' she said to susan . `` i ve not been to bed , '' repli the girl . the woman stretch herself , sat up , thrust her thick , stocking leg over the side of the bed . she slept in all her cloth but her skirt , waist , and shoe . she kneel down upon the bare , sprung , and slant floor , said a prayer , aros with a beam face . `` it 's nice and warm in the room . how i do dread the winter , the cold weather -- though no doubt we'll make out all right ! everyth alway doe turn out well for me . the lord take care of me . i must make me a cup of tea . '' `` i ve made it , '' said susan . the tea was fright stuff -- not tea at all , but cheap adulter color poison . everyth they got was of the same qualiti ; yet the price they paid for the tini quantiti they were abl to buy at ani one time were at a rate that would have bought the finest qualiti at the most expens groceri in new york . `` wonder whi mrs. reardon do n't come ? '' said mrs. tucker . mrs. reardon had as her onli work a one night job at scrub . `` she ought to have come an hour ago . '' `` her rheumat was bad when she start , '' said susan . `` i guess she work slow . '' when mrs. tucker had finish her second cup she put on her shoe , overskirt and waist , made a few pass at her hair . she was readi to go to work . susan look at her , murmur : `` an honest , god-fear work woman ! '' `` huh ? '' said mrs. tucker . `` noth , '' repli susan who would not have permit her to hear . it would be cruel to put such idea befor one doom beyond hope . susan was utter tire , but even the strong crave for a stimul could not draw that tea past her lip . she ate a piec of dri bread , wash her face , neck , and hand . it was time to start for the factori . that day -- saturday -- was a half-holiday . susan drew her week earn -- four dollar and ten cent -- and came home . mrs. tucker , who had drawn -- '' thank to the lord '' -- three dollar and a quarter , was with her . the janitress halt them as they pass and told them that mrs. reardon was dead . she look like anoth scrubwoman , live down the street , who was known alway to carri a sum of money in her dress pocket , the bank be untrustworthi . mrs. reardon , pass along in the dusk of the earli morn , had been hit on the head with a blackjack . the one blow had kill her . violenc , tragedi of all kind , were too commonplac in that neighborhood to caus more than a slight rippl . an old scrubwoman would have had to die in some peculiar aw way to receiv the flatteri of agit an agit street . mrs. reardon had die what was realli almost a natur death . so the faint disturb of the terror of life had long sinc disappear . the bodi was at the morgu , of cours . `` we ll go up , right away , '' said mrs. tucker . `` i ve someth to do that ca n't be put , off , '' repli susan . `` i do n't like for anyon as young as you to be so hard , '' reproach mrs. tucker . `` is it hard , '' said susan , `` to see that death is n't near so terribl as life ? she 's safe and at peac . i ve got to _live_ . '' mrs. tucker , eager for an emot and religi opportun , hasten away . susan went at her wardrob iron , darn , fix buttonhol , hook and eye . she drew a bucket of water from the tap in the hall and proceed to wash her hair with soap ; she rins it , dri it as well as she could with their one small , thin towel , left it hang free for the air to finish the job . it had rain all the night befor -- the second heavi rain in two month . but at dawn the rain had ceas , and the cloud had fled befor the sun that rule almost undisput nine month of the year and war valiant to rule the other three month -- not altogeth in vain . a few golden stray found their way into that cavelik room and had been help her wonder . she bath herself and scrub herself from head to foot . she manicur her nail , got her hand and feet into fair good condit . she put on her best undercloth , her one remain pair of undarn stock , the pair of tie she had been save against an emerg . and onc more she had the charm upon which she most pride herself -- the charm of an attract look about the feet and ankl . she then took up the dark-blu hat frame -- one of a lot of `` second '' -- she had bought for thirty-f cent at a bargain sale , trim it with a broad dark-blu ribbon for which she had paid sixti cent . she was well pleas -- and just so -- with the result . the trim hat might well have cost ten or fifteen dollar -- for the largest part of the price of a woman 's hat is usual the tast of the arrang of the trim . by this time her hair was dri . she did it up with a care she had not had time to give it in mani a week . she put on the dark-blu serg skirt of the between season dress she had brought with her from forty-fourth street ; she had not worn it at all . with the feebl aid of the mirror that distort her imag into grotesqu , she put on her hat with the care that import detail of a woman 's toilet alway deserv . she complet her toilet with her one good and unworn blous -- plain white , the yoke grace point -- and with a blue neck piec she had been save . she made a bundl of all her cloth that was fit for anyth -- includ the unworn batist dress jeffri and jona had given her . and into it she put the pistol she had brought away from forty-fourth street . she made a separ bundl of the jeffri and jona hat with it valuabl plume . with the two bundl she descend and went to a pawnshop in houston street , to which she had made sever visit . a dirty-look man with a short beard fluffi and thick like a yellow hen 's tail lurk behind the counter in the dark littl shop . she put her bundl on the counter , open them . `` how much can i get for these thing ? '' she ask . the man examin everi piec minut . `` there 's realli noth here but the summer dress and the hat , '' said he . `` and they'r out of style . i ca n't give you more than four dollar for the lot -- and one for the pistol which is good but old style now . five dollar . how ll you have it ?

'' susan put it on the counter again . said she : '' i do n't blame you for tri to do me . you re right to tri to buy your way out of hell . '' the pawnbrok reflect , could not understand this subtleti , went behind his counter . he produc a key from his pocket , unlock a drawer underneath and took out a larg tin box . with anoth key from anoth pocket he unlock this , threw back the lid reveal a disord of paper . from the depth he fish a paper bag . this contain a roll of bill . he gave susan a twenti and a five , both cover with dirt so thick that she could scarc make out the denomin . `` you ll have to give me cleaner money than this , '' said she . `` you are a fine ladi , '' grumbl he . but he found cleaner bill . she turn to her room . at sight of her mrs. tucker burst out laugh with delight . `` my , but you do look like old time ! '' cri she . `` how neat and tasti you are ! i suppos it 's no need to ask if you re go to church ? '' `` no , '' said susan . `` i ve got noth to give , and i do n't beg . '' `` well , i ai n't go there myself , late -- somehow . they got so they were n't veri cordial -- or mayb it was me think that way becaus i was n't dress up like . still i do wish you was more religi . but you ll come to it , for you re natur a good girl . and when you do , the lord ll give you a more content heart . not that you complain . i never knew anybodi , especi a young person , that took thing so quiet . . . . it ca n't be you re go to a danc ? '' `` no , '' said susan . `` i 'm go to leav -- go back uptown . '' mrs. tucker plump down upon the bed . `` leav for good ? '' she gasp . `` i ve got nelli lemay to take my place here , if you want her , '' said susan . `` here is my share of the rent for next week and half a dollar for the extra gas i ve burn last night and today . '' `` and mrs. reardon gone , too ! '' sob mrs. tucker , sudden rememb the old scrubwoman whom both had forgotten . `` and up to that there morgu they would n't let me see her except where the light was so poor that i could n't right swear it was her . how brutal everybodi is to the poor ! if they didn't have the lord , what would becom of them ! and you leav me all alon ! '' the sob rose into hysteria . susan stood impass . she had seen again and again how faint the breez that would throw those shallow water into commot and how soon they were tranquil again . it was by observ mrs. tucker that she first learn an import unrecogn truth about human natur that amiabl , easili sympathet and habitu good-humor peopl are invari hard of heart . in this part she had no sens of loss , none of the melancholi that often oppress us when we separ from someon to whom we are indiffer yet feel bound by the tie of misfortun born togeth . mrs. tucker , fallen into the habit of their surround , was for her simpli part of them . and she was glad she was leav them -- forev , she hope . _christian_ , flee the citi of destruct , had no sterner mandat to flight than her instinct was sudden urg upon her . when mrs. tucker saw that her tear were not appreci , she decid that they were unnecessari . she dri her eye and said : '' anyhow , i reckon mrs. reardon 's taking-off was a merci . '' `` she 's better dead , '' said susan . she had abhor the old woman , even as she piti and shelter her . she had a way of fawn and cring and flatter -- no doubt in well mean attempt to show gratitud -- but it was unendur to susan . and now that she was dead and gone , there was no call for further pretens . `` you ai n't go right away ?

'' susan , silent , her thought flow like a mill race , help ida with the dish . then they dress and went togeth for a walk . it be sunday even , the street were quiet . they saunter up fifth avenu as far as fifty-ninth street and back . ida 's calm and sensibl demeanor gave susan much need courag everi time a man spoke to them . none of these men happen to be up to ida 's standard , which was high . `` no use wast time on snide peopl , '' explain she . `` we do n't want drink and a gush of loos talk , and i saw at a glanc that was all those chappi were good for . '' they return home at half-past nine without adventur . toward midnight one of ida 's regular call and susan was free to go to bed . she slept hard at all . ever befor her mind hover a nameless , shapeless horror . and when she slept she dream of her wed night , woke herself scream , `` pleas , mr . ferguson -- pleas ! '' ida had three chief sourc of revenu . the best was five men -- her `` regular gentleman friend '' -- who call by appoint from time to time . these paid her ten dollar apiec , and occasion gave her present of money or jewelri -- noth that amount to much . from them she averag about thirty-f dollar a week . her second sourc was a mrs. thurston who kept in west fifty-sixth street near ninth avenu a furnished-room hous of the sort that is on the offici -- and also the `` revenu '' -- list of the polic and the anti-vic societi . this ladi had a list of girl and marri women upon whom she could call . gentlemen use her hous for rendezv were sometim disappoint by the ladi with whom they were intrigu . again a gentleman grew a littl weari of his perhap too respect or too sincer love ladylov and appeal to mrs. thurston . she kept her list of avail most select and pass them off as women of good posit will to supplement a small incom , or to punish stingi husband or father and at the same time get the money they need for dress and bridg , for matine and lunch . mrs. thurston insist -- and ida was inclin to believ -- that there were genuin case of this kind on the list . `` it 's mighti hard for women with expens tast and small mean to keep straight in new york , '' said she to susan . `` it cost so much to live , and there are so mani way to spend money . and they alway have rich ladi friend who set an extravag pace . they ve got to dress -- and to kind of keep up their end . so -- '' ida laugh , went on : `` besid the citi women are get so they like a littl sporti novelti as much as their brother and husband and father do . oh , i 'm not asham of my busi ani more . we re as good as the other , and we re not hypocrit . as my lawyer friend say , everybodi 's got to make a _good_ live , and good live can't be made on the way that use to be call on the level -- they re call damfool way now . '' ida 's third sourc of incom was to her the most attract becaus it had such a larg gambl element in it . this was her flirtat as a respect woman in search of live amus and have to take care not to be caught . there are women of all kind who delight in deceiv men becaus it give them a sweet stealthi sens of superior to the condescend sex . in women of the ida class this pleasur becom as much a passion as it is in the respect woman whom her husband tri to enslav . with susan , anoth woman and one in need of educ , ida was simpl and scrupul truth . but it would have been imposs for a man to get truth as to anyth from her . she amus herself invent plausibl romant stori about herself that she might enjoy the gullibl of the boast superior and patron male . she was devoid of sentiment , even of passion . yet at time she affect both in the most extrem fashion . and afterward , with peal of laughter , she would describ to susan how the man had act , what an ass she had made of him . `` men despis us , '' she said . `` but it 's noth to the way i despis them . the best of them are rotten beast when they show themselv as they are . and they have n't ani merci on us . it 's too ridicul . men despis a man who is virtuous and a woman who is n't . what rot !

'' upon the men with whom she flirt , she practic the high color romanc it would have been useless to tri upon the regular . her greatest triumph at this game was a hard luck stori she had told so effect that the man had given her two hundr dollar . most of her romanc turn about her own ruin . as a matter of fact , she had told susan the exact truth when she said she had taken up her mode of life deliber ; she had grown weari and impati of the increas poverti of a famili which , like so mani of the artisan and small merchant and profession class in this day of concentr wealth and spread tast for comfort and luxuri , was on it way down from comfort toward or through the tenement . she was a type of the recruit that are swell the prostitut class in ever larger number and are drive the prostitut of the tenement class toward starvat -- where they onc domin the profess even to it highest rank , even to the fashion _cocotes_ who prey upon the second generat of the rich . but ida never told her lover her plain and commonplac tale of yield to the irresist pressur of econom forc . she had made men weep at her recit of her wrong . it had even brought her offer of marriag -- none , howev , worth accept . `` i 'd be a boob to marri a man with less than fifteen or twenti thousand a year , would n't i ? '' said she . `` whi , two of the marri men who come to see me regular give me more than they give their wive for pin money . and in a few year i ll be have my own respect busi , with ten thousand incom -- mayb more -- and as well thought of as the next woman .

'' exclaim she . `` other have -- of cours , you do n't know about them -- they ve look out for that . yes , lot of other have -- but -- well , just you watch your sister ida . '' and susan felt that she would inde arriv . alreadi she had seen that there was no difficulti such as she had onc imagin about recross the line to respect . the onli real problem in that matter was how to get togeth enough to make the cross worth while -- for what was there in respect without money , in a day when respect had ceas to mean anyth but money ? ida wish to take her to mrs. thurston and get her a favor place on the list . susan thank her , but said , `` not yet -- not quit yet . '' ida suggest that they go out togeth as two young marri women whose husband had gone on the road . susan put her off from day to day . ida final offer to introduc her to one of the regular : `` he 's a nice fellow -- know how to treat a ladi in a gentleman way . not a bit coars or familiar . '' susan would not permit this generos . and all this time her fund were sink . she had paid a second week rent , had bought cook apparatus , some food suppli , some necessari cloth . she was down to a five-dollar bill and a littl chang . `` look here , lorna , '' said ida , between remonstr and exasper , `` when _are_ you go to start in ?

'' meanwhil she continu to search for work -- work that would enabl her to live _decently_ , wage less degrad than the wage of shame . in a newspap she read an advertis of a theatric agenc . advertis of all kind read well ; those of theatric agenc read -- like the fairi tale that they were . howev , she found in this particular offer of dazzl career and salari a peculiar phrase that decid her to break the rule she had made after have investig score of this sort of offer . rod was abroad ; anyhow , enough time had elaps . one of the most impress featur of the effect of new york -- mean by '' new york '' onli that small but signific portion of the four million that think -- at least , after a fashion , and act , instead of be mere passiv tool of whatev happen to turn up -- the most familiar notabl effect of this new york is the speedi distinct in the newcom of those illus and delus about life and about human natur , about good and evil , that are for so mani peopl the most precious and the onli endur and beauti thing in the world . new york , destroy of delus and cherish hypocrisi and pretens , therefor make the broad intellig of it citizen hardi , make the other hard -- and between the hardi and hard , between sens and cynic , yawn a gulf like that between absalom and dive . susan , a new yorker now , had got the habit -- in thought , at least -- of see thing with somewhat less distort from the actual . she no longer exagger the import of the rod-susan episod . she saw that in new york , where life is crowd with event , everyth in one 's life , except death , becom incid , becom episod , where in region offer less to think about each rare happen took on an aspect of vast import . the rod-susan love adventur , she now saw , was not what it would have seem -- therefor , would have been -- in sutherland , but was mere episod of a new york life , give it light and shade to a certain small part of the long , vari pattern fabric of her life , and of his , not determin the whole . she saw that it was simpli like a bend in the river , give a new turn to current and cours but not chang the river itself , and soon left far behind and succeed by other bend give each it equal or greater turn to the stream . rod had pass from her life , and she from his life . thus she was free to begin her real career -- the stage -- if she could . she went to the suit of offic tenant by mr. josiah ransom . she was usher in to ransom himself , instead of halt with underl . she owe this favor to advantag which her lack of vaniti and of self-consci prevent her from surmis . ransom -- smooth , cur , comfort look -- receiv her with a delic blend of the patern and the gallant . after he had inspect her exterior with flatter attent and had investig her qualif with a thorough that was convinc of sincer he said : '' most satisfactori ! i can make you an except assur . if you regist with me , i can guarante you not less than twenty-f a week .

'' `` perhap , '' said susan . `` but i hope not . it ll take uncommon luck to pull you through -- and i hope you ll have it . '' `` thank you , '' said susan . he took her hand , press it friendlili -- and she felt that he was a man with real good in him , more good than mani who would have shrunk from him in horror . she was wait for a thrust from fate . but fate , disappoint as usual , would not thrust . it seem bent on the malici pleasur of compel her to degrad herself deliber and with calcul , like a woman marri for support a man who refus to permit her to decor with ani artifici floral conceal of faked-up sentiment the sordid truth as to what she is about . she search within herself in vain for the scrupl or sentiment or timid or whatev it was that held her back from the cours that was plain inevit . she had got down to the nake fundament of decenc and indec that are deep hidden by , and for most of us under , hypocrisi of convent . she had found out that a decent woman was one who respect her bodi and her soul , that an indec woman was one who did not , and that marriag rite or the absenc of them , the absenc of financi or equival consider , or it presenc , or it extent or it form , were all irrelev non-essenti . yet -- she hesit , know the while that she was risk a greater degrad , and a stupid and fatal folli to boot , by shrink from the best cours open to her -- unless it were better to take a dose of poison and end it all . she probabl would have done that had she not been so utter healthi , therefor overflow with passion love of life . except in fiction suicid and health do not go togeth , howev superhuman sensit the sore beset hero or heroin . susan was sensit enough ; whenev she did thing incompat with our fals and hypocrit and unscientif notion of sensit , allow should be made for her becaus of her superb and dauntless health . if her physic condit had been morbid , her conduct might have been , would have been , veri differ . she was still hesit when saturday night came round again -- swift despit long dishearten day , and wake aw night . in the morn her rent would be due . she had a dollar and forty-f cent . after dinner alon a pretens at dinner -- she wander the street of the old tenderloin until midnight . an ici rain was fall . rain such as this -- ani rain except shower -- were rare in the citi of the sun . that rain by itself was enough to make her downheart . she walk with head down and umbrella close to her shoulder . no one spoke to her . she return drip ; she had all but ruin her one dress . she went to bed , but not to sleep . about nine -- earli for that hous she rose , drank a cup of coffe and ate part of a roll . her littl stove and such other thing as could not be taken along she roll into a bundl , mark it , `` for ida . '' on a scrap of paper she wrote this note : do n't think i 'm ungrat , pleas . i 'm go without say good-bi becaus i 'm afraid if i saw you , you 'd be generous enough to put up for me , and i 'd be weak enough to accept . and if i did that , i 'd never be abl to get strong or even to hold my head up . so -- good-bi . i ll learn sooner or later -- learn how to live . i hope it wo n't be too long -- and that the teacher wo n't be too hard on me . yes , i ll learn , and i ll buy fine hat at your grand millineri store yet . do n't forget me altogeth . she tuck this note into the bundl and laid it against the door behind which ida and one of her regular were sleep peac . the odor of ida 's power perfum came through the crack in the door ; susan drew it eager into her nostril , sob soft , turn away , it was one of the perfum class as immor ; to susan it was the aroma of a friendship as nobl , as disinterest , as generous , as human sympathi had ever breath upon human woe . with her few person possess in a packag she descend the stair unnot , went out into the rain . at the corner of sixth avenu she paus , look up and down the street . it was almost desert . now and then a streetwalk , rous earli by a lover with perhap a famili wait for him , hurri by , look piteous in the daylight which show up fals and dy hair , the layer of paint , the sad tawdri of batter fineri from the cheapest bargain trough . susan went slowli up sixth avenu . two block , and she saw a girl enter the side door of a saloon across the way . she cross the street , push in at the same door , went on to a small sitting-room with blind drawn , with round tabl , on everi tabl a match stand . it was one of those place where streetwalk rest their weari leg between stroll , and sit for compani on raini or snowi night , and take shi men for sociability-breed drink and for the preliminari bargain . the air of the room was strong with stale liquor and tobacco , the linger aroma of the night 's vanish revel . in the far corner sat the girl she had follow ; a glass of raw whiskey and anoth of water stood on the tabl befor her . susan seat herself near the door and when the swollen-fac , sur bartend came , order whiskey . she pour herself a drink -- fill the glass to the brim . she drank it in two gulp , set the empti glass down . she shiver like an anim as it is hit in the head with a poleax . the mechan of life stagger , hesit , went on with a sudden leap acceler of pace . susan tap her glass against the matchstand . the bartend came . `` anoth , '' said she . the man stare at her . `` the -- hell !

'' `` when i ve had anoth drink , '' said susan . her eye were gorgeous brilliant . she had felt almost as reckless sever time befor ; but never had she felt this devil-may-car eager to see what the turn of the next card would bring . `` you ll take one ?

'' while susan was have two more drink maud talk about freddi . she seem to know littl about him , though he was evid one of the conspicu figur . he had start in the lower east side -- had been leader of one of those gang that infest tenement district -- the young men who refus to submit to the common lot of stupid and bad paid toil and tri to fight their way out by the quick method of violenc instead of the slower but surer method of rob the poor through a store of some kind . these gang were thiev , blackmail , kidnap of young girl for hous of prostitut , repeat . most of them graduat into habitu jailbird , a few -- the cleverest -- becam saloon-keep and politician and high-class profession gambler and race track men . freddi , maud explain , was not much over twenty-f , yet was alreadi well up toward the place where success gang leader cross over into the respect class -- that is , graft in '' big figur . '' he was a great reader , said maud , and had taken cours at some colleg . `` they say he and his gang use to kill somebodi near everi night . then he got a lot of money out of one of his job -- some say it was a bank robberi and some say they kill a miner who was drunk with a big roll on him . anyhow , freddi got next to finnegan -- he 's worth sever million that he made out of polici shop and poolroom , and contract and such polit thing . so he 's in right -- and he got the brain . he 's a good one for work out scheme for make peopl work hard and bring him their money . and everybodi 's afraid of him becaus he wo n't stop at noth and is too slick to get caught . '' maud broke off abrupt and rose , warn by the glaze look in susan 's eye . susan was so far gone that she had difficulti in not stagger and did not dare speak lest her uncertain tongu should betray her . maud walk her up and down the block sever time to give the fresh air a chanc , then led her up to a man who had look at them in pass and had paus to look back . `` want to go have a good time , sweetheart ?

'' `` i 'm readi for anyth , '' declar she giddili . `` i do n't give a damn . i 'm over the line . i -- _don't_ -- give -- a -- damn ! '' `` i use to hate the men i went up with , '' said maud , `` but now i hard look at their face . you ll soon be that way . then you ll onli drink for fun . drink -- and dope -- they are about the onli fun we have -- them and care about some fellow . '' `` how mani girl has freddi got ? '' `` search me . not mani that he 'd speak to himself . jim 's his wardman -- doe his collect for him . freddi 's abov most of the men in this busi . the other are about like jim -- tough straight through , but freddi 's a kind of a pullman . the other men-even jim -- hate him for be such a snare and be abl to hide it that he 's in such a low busi . they 'd have done him up long ago , if they could . but he 's to wise for them . that whi they have to do what he say . i tell you , you re in right , for sure . you ll have freddi eat out of your hand , if you play a cool hand . '' susan order anoth drink and a packag of egyptian cigarett . `` they do n't allow ladi to smoke in here , '' said maud . `` we ll go to the washroom . '' and in the washroom they took a few hasti puff befor salli forth again . usual sunday night was dull , all the men have spent their spare money the night befor , and it be a bad night for marri men to make excus for get away from home . maud explain that , except `` out-of-town , '' the marri men were the chief support of their profess -- '' and most of the cornhusk are marri men , too . '' but susan had the novic 's luck . when she and maud met maud 's `` littl gentleman friend '' harri tucker at midnight and went to considin 's for supper , susan had taken in `` present '' and commiss twenty-nin dollar and a half . maud had not done so bad , herself ; her net receipt were twenty-two fifti . she would not let susan pay ani part of the supper bill , but gave harri the necessari money . `` here 's a five , '' said she , press the bill into his hand , `` and keep the chang . '' and she look at him with love eye of long . he was a pretti , common-look fellow , a mere boy , who clerk in a haberdasheri in the neighborhood . as he got onli six dollar a week and had to give five to his mother who sew , he could not afford to spend money on maud , and she neither expect nor wish it . when she pick him up , he like most of his fellow-clerk had no decent cloth but the suit he had to have to `` make a front '' at the store . maud had outfit him from the skin with the cheap but showi stuff exhibit for just such purpos in the broadway window . she explain confidenti to susan : '' it make me sort of feel that i own him . then , too , in love there ought n't to be ani money . if he paid , i 'd be as cold to him as i am to the rest . the onli reason i like jim at all is i like a good beat onc in a while . it 's excit . jim -- he treat me like the dirt under his feet . and that 's what we are -- dirt under the men 's feet . everi woman know it , when it come to a showdown between her and a man . as my pop use to say , the world was made for men , not for women . still , our graft ai n't so bum , at that -- if we work it right . '' freddi call on susan about noon the next day . she was still in bed . he was dress in the extrem of fashion , was wear a chinchilla-lin coat . he look the idl , sportiv inclin son of some rich man in the fifth avenu district . he was have an affair with a much admir young actress -- was engag in it rather as a matter of vaniti and for the fashion half-world associ into which it introduc him rather than from ani present interest in the ladi . he stood watch susan with a peculiar express -- one he might perhap have found it hard to defin himself . he bent over her and careless brush her ear with his lip . `` how did your royal high make out ? '' inquir he . `` the money 's in the top bureau drawer , '' repli she , the cover up to her eye and her eye close . he went to the bureau , open the drawer , with his glove hand count the money . as he count his eye had a look in them that was strang like jealous rage . he kept his back toward her for some time after he had cross to look at the money . when he spoke it was to say : '' not bad . and when you get dress up a bit and lose your stage fright , you ll do a smash busi . i ll not take my share of this . i had a good run with the card last night . anyhow , you ve got to pay your rent and buy some cloth . i'v got to invest someth in my new properti . it 's bad run down . you ll get busi again tonight , of cours . never lay off , ladi , unless the weather 's bad . you ll find you won't averag more than twenti good busi day a month in summer and fall , and onli about ten in winter and spring , when it cold and often lot of bad weather in the afternoon and even . that mean hustl .

'' `` too much booz , i ll bet . well , sleep your grouch off . i'v got a date with finnegan . the elect 's come on , and i have to work -- line up the vote and get the repeat readi . it all mean good money for me . look out about the booz , ladi . it ll float you into troubl -- troubl with me , i mean . '' and he pat her bare shoulder , laugh gentl , went to the door . he paus there , struggl with an impuls to turn -- depart . chapter vii but she did not `` look out about the booz . '' each morn she awok in a state of depress so horribl that she wonder whi she could not bring herself to plan suicid . whi was it ? her marriag ? yes -- and she paid it it customari tribut of a shudder . yes , her marriag had made all thing thereaft possibl . but what els ? lack of courag ? lack of self-respect ? was it not alway assum that a woman in her posit , if she had a grain of decent instinct , would rush eager upon death ? was she so much wors than other ? or was what everybodi said about these thing -- everybodi who had experi -- was it fals , like near everyth els she had been taught ? she did not understand ; she onli knew that hope was as strong within her as health itself -- and that she did not want to die -- and that at present she was helpless . one even the man she was with -- a good-look and unusu interest young chap -- sudden said : '' what a heart action you have got ! let me listen to that again . '' `` is it all wrong ? '' ask susan , as he press his ear against her chest . `` you ask that as if you rather hope it was . '' `` i do -- and i do n't . '' `` well , '' said he , after listen for a third time , `` you'll never die of heart troubl . i never heard a heart with such a grand action -- like a big , power pump , built to last forev . you re never ill , are you ? '' `` not thus far . '' `` and you ll have a hard time make yourself ill. health ? whi , your health must be perfect . let me see . '' and he proceed to thump and press upon her chest with an expert that proclaim the student of medicin . he was all interest and enthusiasm , took a pencil and , spread a sheet upon her chest over her heart , drew it outlin . `` there ! '' he cri . `` what is it ? '' ask susan . `` i do n't understand . '' the young man drew a second and much smaller heart within the outlin of her . `` this , '' he explain , `` is about the size of an ordinari heart . you can see for yourself that your is fulli one-fourth bigger than the normal . '' `` what of it ? '' said susan . `` whi , health and strength -- and vital -- courag -- hope -- all one-fourth abov the ordinari allow . yes , more than a fourth . i envi you . you ought to live long , stay young until you re veri old -- and get pretti much anyth you pleas . you do n't belong to this life . some accid , i guess . everi onc in a while i run across a case someth like your . you ll go back where you belong . this is a dip , not a drop . '' `` you sound like a fortune-tel . '' she was smile mock . but in truth she had never in all her life heard word that thrill her so , that hearten her so . `` i am . a scientif fortune-tel . and what that kind say come true , bar accid . as you re not ignor and careless this life of your is n't physiolog bad . on the contrari , you re out in the open air much of the time and get the splendid exercis of walk -- a much more health life , in the essenti way , than respect women lead . they'r alway stuf , and rump it . they never move if they can help . no , noth can stop you but death -- unless you re far less intellig than you look . oh , yes -- death and one other thing . '' `` drink . '' and he look shrewd at her . but drink she must . and each day , as soon as she dress and was out in the street , she began to drink , and kept it up until she had driven off the depress and had got herself into the mood of reckless in which she found a certain sardon pleasur in outrag her own sensibl . there is a stage in a drink career when the man or the woman becom deprav and ugli as soon as the liquor take effect . but she was far from this advanc stage . her disposit was , if anyth , more sweet and generous when she was under the influenc of liquor . the whiskey -- she almost alway drank whiskey -- seem to act direct and onli upon the nerv that ach and throb when she was sober , the nerv that made the life she was lead seem loathsom beyond the power of habit to accustom . with these nerv stupefi , her natur gayeti assert itself , and a fond for quiet and subtl mockeri -- her indulg in it did not make her popular with vain men suffici acut to catch her mean . by observ and practic she was soon abl to measur the exact amount of liquor that was necessari to produc the proper state of intox at the hour for go `` on duti . '' that gayeti of her was of the surfac onli . behind it her real self remain indiffer or somber or sardon , accord to her mood of the day . and she had the sens of be in the grasp of a hideous , fascin nightmar , of be drag through some dread probat from which she would present emerg to ascend to the posit she would have earn by her desper fortitud . the past -- unreal . the present -- a wake dream . but the futur -- ah , the futur ! he has not candid explor far beneath the surfac of thing who doe not know the strang allur , charm even , that mani loathsom thing possess . and drink is peculiar fit to bring out this pervers qualiti -- drink that blur all the convent , even those built up into moral idea by centuri and age of unbroken custom . the human anim , for all it pretens of inflex , is almost infinit adapt -- that is whi it has risen in sever million year of evolut from about the humblest rank in the mammalian famili to overlordship of the univers . still , it is doubt if , without drink to help her , a girl of susan 's intellig and tempera would have been apt to endur . she would probabl have chosen the altern -- death . hundr , perhap thousand , of girl , at least her equal in sensibl , are caught in the same calam everi year , ten of thousand , ever more and more as our civil transform under the pressur of industri , are caught in the similar calam of soul-destroy toil . and onli the few surviv who have perfect health and abound vital . susan 's iron strength enabl her to live ; but it was drink that enabl her to endur . beyond question one of the greatest bless that could now be confer upon the race would be to cure it of the drink evil . but at the same time , if drink were taken away befor the caus of drink were remov , there would be an appal increas in suicid -- in insan , in the general total of human miseri . for while drink retard the growth of intellig effort to end the stupid in the social system , doe it not also help men and women to bear the consequ of those stupid ? our crude and undevelop new civil , strap men and women and children to the machin and squeez all the energi out of them , all the capac for vital life , cast them asid as soon as they are useless but long befor they are dead . how unutter wretch they would be without drink to give them illus ! susan grew fond of cigarett , fond of whiskey ; to the rest she after a few week becam numb -- no new or strang phenomenon in a world where peopl with a cancer or other hideous run sore or some gross and fright deform of fat or excresc are seen laugh , join freeli and comfort in the compani of the unafflict . in her afflict susan at least saw onli those affect like herself -- and that help not a littl , help the whiskey to confus and distort her outlook upon life . the old cartesian formula -- '' i think , therefor i am '' -- would come nearer to express a truth , were it revers -- '' i am , therefor i think . '' our charact are compress , and our thought bent by our environ . and most of us are unconsci of our slaveri becaus our environ remain unchang from birth until death , and so seem the whole univers to us . in spite of her life , in spite of all she did to disguis herself , there persist in her face -- even when she was daze or giddi or stupefi with drink -- the express of the woman on the right side of the line . whether it was someth in her charact , whether it was not rather due to superior of breed and intellig , would be difficult to say . howev , there was the _different_ look that irrit mani of the other girl , interf with her busi and made her feel a hypocrit . she heard so much about the pale of her lip that she decid to end that comment by use paint -- the durabl kind ida had recommend . when her lip flame carmin , a strang and strike effect result . the sad sweet pensiv of her eye -- the pallor of her clear skin -- then , that splash of bright red , artifici , bold , defiant -- the contrast of the combin seem somehow to tell the stori of her life her past no less than her present . and when her beauti began to come back -- for , hard though her life was , it was a life of good food , of plenti of sleep , of much open air ; so it put no such strain upon her as had the life of the factori and the tenement -- when her beauti came back , the effect of that contrast of scarlet splash against the sad puriti of pallid cheek and violet-gray eye becam a mark of individu , of distinct . it was not long befor susan would have as soon thought of issu forth with her bodi uncov as with her lip unroug . she turn away from men who sought her a second time . she was difficult to find , she went on `` duti '' onli enough day each week to earn a low averag of what was expect from the girl by their protector . yet she got mani unexpect present -- and so had money to lend to the other girl , who soon learn how '' easi '' she was . maud , sometim at her own prompt , sometim prompt by jim , who was prompt by freddi -- warn her everi few day that she was skate on the thinnest of ice . but she went her way . not until she accompani a girl to an opium joint to discov whether dope had the merit claim for it as a deaden of pain and a produc of happi -- not until then did freddi come in person . `` i hear , '' said he and she wonder whether he had heard from max or from loose-tongu maud -- '' that you come into the hotel so drunk that men sometim leav you right away again -- go without pay you . '' `` i must drink , '' said susan . `` you must _stop_ drink , '' retort he , amiabl in his terribl way . `` if you do n't , i ll have you pinch and sent up . that ll bring you to your sens . '' `` i must drink , '' said susan . `` then i must have you pinch , '' said he with his mock laugh . `` do n't be a fool , '' he went on . `` you can make money enough to soon buy the right sort of cloth so that i can afford to be seen with you . i 'd like to take you out onc in a while and give you a swell time . but what 'd we look like togeth -- with you in those cheap thing out of bargain trough ? not that you do n't look well -- for you do . but the rest of you is n't up to your feet and to the look in your face . the whole thing 's got to be right befor a ladi can sit opposit _me_ in murray 's or rector 's . '' `` all i ask is to be let alon , '' said susan . `` that is n't play squar -- and you ve got to play squar . what i want is to set you up in a nice parlor trade -- chap from the colleg and the swell club and hotel . but i ca n't do anyth for you as long as you drink this way . you ll have to stay on the street . '' `` that 's where i want to stay . '' `` well , there 's someth to be said for the street , '' freddi admit . `` if a woman do n't intend to make sport her life busi , she do n't want to get up among the swell of the profess , where she 'd becom known and find it hard to sidestep . still , even in the street you ought to make a hundr , easi -- and not go with ani man that doe n't suit you . '' `` ani man that doe n't suit me , '' said susan . and , after a paus , she said it again : `` ani man that doe n't suit me . '' the young man , with his shrewd of the street-gradu and his sensit of the italian , gave her an understand glanc . `` you look as if you could n't decid whether to laugh or cri . i 'd tri to laugh if i was you . '' she had laugh as he spoke . freddi nod approv . `` that sound good to me . you'r get broken in . do n't take yourself so serious . after all , what are you do ? whi , learn to live like a man . '' she found this new point of view interest -- and true , too . like a man -- like all men , except possibl a few -- not enough except to chang the rule . like a man ; get herself harden up to the point where she could take part in the cruel struggl on equal term with the men . it was n't their differ of bodi ani more than it was their differ of dress that handicap women ; it was the idea behind skirt and sex -- and she was get rid of that . . . . the theori was admir ; but it help her not at all in practic . she continu to keep to the dark , to wait in the deep doorway , so far as she could in her `` busi hour , '' and to repuls advanc in the day time or in public place -- and to drink . she did not go again to the opium joint , and she resist the night offer of girl and their '' gentlemen friend '' to tri cocain in it various form . `` dope , '' she saw , was the medicin of despair . and she was far from despair . had she not youth ? had she not health and intellig and good look ? some day she would have finish her apprenticeship . then -- the career ! freddi let her alon for near a month , though she was earn less than fifti dollar a week -- which meant onli thirti for him . he had never `` collect '' from her direct , but alway through jim ; and she had now learn enough of the method of the system of which she was one of the thousand of slave to appreci that she was treat by jim with uniqu consider . not onli by the sur and brutal jim , but also by the polic who oppress in petti way wherev they dare becaus they hate freddi 's system which took away from them a part of the graft they regard as right their . yes , right their . and anyon dispos to be critic of polic moral -- or of freddi palmer moral -- in this matter of graft would do well to paus and consid the sourc of his own incom befor he wax too eloqu and too virtuous . graft is one of those general word that mean everyth and noth . what is graft and what is honest incom ? just where shall we draw the line between right exploit of our fellow-b through their necess and their ignor of their helpless , and wrong exploit ? do attempt to draw that line resolv down to make virtuous whatev i may appropri and vicious whatev is appropri in way other than mine ? and if so are not the polic and the palmer entitl to their day in the moral court no less than the tariff-baron and market-corner , the herder and driver of wage slave , the retail artist in cold storag filth , short weight and shoddi good ? howev , `` we must draw the line somewher '' or there will be no such thing as moral under our social system . so whi not draw it at anyth the other fellow doe to make money . in adopt this simpl rule , we not onli preserv the moral from destruct but also establish our own virtu and the other fellow 's villaini . truli , never is the human race so delight , so unconsci , amus as when it discuss right and wrong . when she saw freddi again , he was far from sober . he show it by his way of begin . said he : '' i ve got to hand you a line of rough talk , queeni . i took on this jag for your especi benefit , '' said he . `` i 'm a fool about you and you take advantag of it . that 's bad for both of us . . . . you re drink as much as ever ?

'' susan had not live in the tenement district where the ignor and the helpless and the lack of a voic that can make itself heard among the rule class make the sway of the polic absolut and therefor tyrann -- she had not live there without get someth of that dread and horror of the polic which to peopl of the upper class seem childish or evid of secret crimin hanker . and this nervous had latter been increas to terror by what she had learn from her fellow-outcast -- the hideous tale of oppress , of robberi , of bodili and moral degrad . but all this terror had been pure fanci , as ani emot not of experi prove to be when experi evok the realiti . at that touch , at the sound of those rough word -- at that _reality_ of the terror she had imagin from the day when she went to work at matson 's and to live with the brashear , she straightway lost conscious . when her sens return she was in a cell , lie on a wooden bench . there must have been some sort of wild struggl ; for her cloth were muddi , her hat was crush into shapeless , her veil was so torn that she had difficulti in arrang it to act as ani sort of conceal . though she had no mirror at which to discov the consol , she need have had no fear of be recogn , so distort were all her featur by the fright paroxysm of grief that swept and ravag her bodi that night . she faint again when they led her out to put her in the wagon . she faint a third time when she heard her name -- '' queeni brown '' -- bellow out by the court offic . they shook her into conscious , led her to the court-room . she was conscious of a stifl heat , of a curious crowd stare at her with eye which seem to bore red hot hole into her flesh . as she stood befor the judg , with head limp upon her bosom , she heard in her ear a rough voic bawl , `` you re discharg . the judg say do n't come here again .

'' `` unless you understand , i could n't make you see it , '' she said . she was sit on the edg of the bed , do up her hair , which had part fallen down . `` i think you do understand . '' `` what in the hell do you want , anyhow ? '' he demand . `` if i knew -- do you suppos i 'd be here ? '' he watch her with baffl , long eye . `` what is it , '' he mutter , `` that 's so damn peculiar about you ? '' it was the question everi shrewd observ person who saw her put to himself in one way or anoth ; and there was excel reason whi this should have been . life has a certain set of mold -- lawyer , financi , gambler , preacher , fashion woman , prostitut , domest woman , labor , clerk , and so on through a not extens list of familiar type with which we all soon becom acquaint . and to one or anoth of these pattern life fit each of us as we grow up . not one in ten thousand glanc into human face is arrest becaus it has lit upon a person that can not be immedi locat , measur , account for . the reason for this steril of varieti which soon make the world rather monoton to the see eye is that few of us are born with ani consider amount of person , and what littl we have is speedili suppress by a system of train which is throughout base upon an abhorr of origin . we obey the law of natur -- and natur so abhor varieti that , whenev a variat from a type happen , she tri to kill it , and , that fail , reproduc it a myriad time to make it a type . when an origin man or woman appear and all the strenuous effort to suppress him or her fail , straightway spring up a thousand imit and copier , and the individu is lost in the school , the fashion , the craze . we have not the courag to be ourselv , even where there is anyth in us that might be develop into someth distinct enough to win us the rank of real ident . individu -- distinct -- where it doe exist , almost never show until experi bring it out -- just as up to a certain stage the embryo of ani anim is like that of everi other anim , though there is latent in it the most posit assert of race and sex , of famili , type , and so on . susan had from childhood possess certain qualiti of physic beauti , of spirited , of facil in mind and bodi -- the not uncommon characterist of the child that is the flower of passion love . but now there was begin to show in her a radic differ from the rest of the crowd pour through the street of the citi . it made the quicker observ in the pass throng turn the head for a second and wonder glanc . most of them assum they had been stir by her superior of face and figur . but strike face and figur of the various come type are frequent in the street of new york and of sever other american citi . the truth was that they were interest by her express -- an elus express tell of a soul that was be move to it depth by experi which usual find and mold mere passiv materi . this express was as evid in her mouth as in her eye , in her profil as in her full face . and as she sat there on the edg of the bed twist up her thick dark hair , it was this express that disconcert freddi palmer , for the first time in all his contemptu deal with the femal sex . in his eye was a feroci desir to seiz her and again tri to conquer and to possess . she had becom almost unconsci of his presenc . he startl her by sudden cri , `` oh , you go to hell ! '' and fling from the room , crash the door shut behind him . maud had grown tire of the haberdash 's clerk and his presumpt upon her frank fond which he wholli misunderstood . she had drop him for a rough look waiter-sing in a basement drink place . he was beat her and take all the money she had for herself , and was spend it on anoth woman , much older than maud and home -- and maud knew , and complain of him bitter to everyon but himself . she was no longer hang round susan persist , have been discourag by the failur of her attempt at intimaci with a girl who spent near all her spare time at read or at play and concert . maud was now chum with a woman who prey upon the patron of a big broadway hotel -- she pick them up near the entranc , rob them , and when they ask the hotel detect to help them get back their stolen money , the detect , who divid with her , frighten them off by say she was a mulatto and would compel them to make a public appear against her in open court . this woman , older and harder than most of the girl , though of quiet and refin appear and manner , was rapid drag maud down . also , maud 's look were go becaus she ate irregular all kind of trash , and late everi night ate herself full to burst and drank herself drunk to stupefact . susan 's first horror of the men she met -- men of all class -- was rapid modifi into an inconsist , therefor characterist human , mingl of horror and toler . nobodi , noth , was either good or bad , but all veer like weathercock in the shift wind . she decid that peopl were steadili good onli where their lot happen to be cast in a place in which the good wind held steadili , and that those who were usual bad simpli had the misfortun to have to live where the prevail wind were bad . for instanc , there was the handsom , well educ , well manner young prize-fight , ned ballou , who was estell '' friend . '' ballou , big and gentl and as incap of bad humor as of constanc or of honesti about money matter , fought under the name of joe geari and was known as upper cut joe becaus usual , in the third round , never later than the fifth , he gave the knockout to his oppon by a cruelli swift and savag uppercut . he had educ himself marvel well . but he had been brought up among thiev and had by some curious freak never learn to know what a moral sens was , which is one -- and a not unattract -- step deeper down than those who know what a moral sens is but never use it . at supper in gaffney 's he relat to susan and estell how he had won his greatest victori -- the victori of terri the cyclon , that had lift him up into the class of secur money-mak . he told how he alway tri to `` rattl '' his oppon by talk to him , by pour out in an underton a stream of gibe , jeer , insult . the afternoon of the fight terri 's first-born had die , but the money for the funer expens and to save the wife from the horror and danger of the free ward had to be earn . joe geari knew that he must win this fight or drop into the work or the crimin class . terri was a `` hard one '' ; so circumst compel , those desper measur which great men , from financi and general down to prize-fight , do not shrink from els they would not be great , but small . as soon as he was face terri in the ring -- joe so he relat with pride in his clever -- began to `` guy '' -- '' well , you irish fake -- so the kid 's dead -- eh ? who was it pa , say ? -- the dirti littl bastard -- or doe the wife know which one it was -- -- '' and so on . and terri , insan with grief and furi , fought wild -- and joe becam a champion . as she listen susan grew cold with horror and with hate . estell said : '' tell the rest of it , joe . '' `` oh , that was noth , '' repli he . when he stroll away to talk with some friend estell told '' the rest '' that was `` noth . '' the championship secur , joe had paid all terri 's bill , had support terri and his wife for a year , had relaps into old habit and `` pull off a job '' of safe-crack becaus , the prize-fight happen to pay poor , he would have had a default on the payment for a month or so . he was caught , did a year on the island befor his '' pull '' could get him out . and all the time he was in the `` pen '' he so arrang it with his friend that the invalid terri and his invalid wife did not suffer . and all this he had done not becaus he had a sens of owe terri , but becaus he was of the `` set '' in which it is the custom to help anybodi who happen to need it , and aid begun becom an oblig to `` see it through . '' it was an extrem case of the moral chao about her -- the chao she had begun to discov when she caught her aunt and ruth conspir to take sam away from her . what a world ! if onli these shift , usual evil wind of circumst could be made to blow good ! a few even after the arrest maud came for susan , persuad her to go out . they dine at about the onli good restaur where unescort women were serv after nightfal . afterward they went `` on duti . '' it was fine overhead and the air was cold and brace -- one of those marvel new york winter night which have the tonic of both sea and mountain and an exhilar , in addit , from the intens bright-burn life of the mighti citi . for more than a week there had been a steadi downpour of snow , sleet and final rain . thus , the women of the street had been do almost no busi . there was not much money in sit in drink hall and the back room of saloon and pick up occasion men ; the best trade was the men who would not ventur to show themselv in such frank disreput place , but pick out women in the crowd street and follow them to quiet dark place to make the arrang -- men stimul by good dinner , or , later on , in the even , those who left parti of eleg respect after theater or opera . on this first night of busi weather in near two week the street were crowd with women and girl . they were desper hard up and they made open dash for everi man they could get at . all class were made equal bold -- the shop and factori and offic and theater girl with wage too small for what they regard as a decent live ; the women with young children to support and educ ; the protect profession regular ; the miser creatur who had to get along as best they could without protect , and were prey to everi blackmail offic of an anti-vic societi and to everi policeman and fly-cop not abov levi upon women who were `` too low to be allow to live , anyhow .

'' she order and slowli drank anoth whiskey befor she recal what she had set out to confid . by way of a fresh start she said , `` what do you think of freddi ? '' `` i do n't know , '' repli susan . and it was the truth . her instinct belief in a modifi kind of fatal made her judgment of peopl -- even of those who caus her to suffer -- singular free from person bitter . freddi , a mere instrument of destini , had his good side , his human side , she knew . at his worst he was no wors than the other , and asid from his queer magnet , there was a certain forc in him that compel her admir ; at least he was not one of the petti instrument of destini . he had in him the same qualiti she felt gestat within herself . `` i do n't know what to think , '' she repeat . maud had been reflect while susan was cast about , as she had mani a time befor , for her real opinion of her master who was in turn the slave of finnegan , who was in his turn the slave of somebodi higher up , she did n't exact know who -- or whi -- or the whi of ani of it -- or the whi of the grotesqu savag purposeless do of destini in general . maud now burst out : '' i do n't care . i 'm go to put you wise if i die for it .

'' and then she shrank away befor the approv laughter of the littl crowd and hurri across into eighth street . in the deep shadow of the front of cooper union she paus , as the mean of her own impuls word came to her . the wage of sin ! and what was sin , the suprem sin , but weak ? it was exact as burlingham had explain . he had said that , whether for good or for evil , realli to live one must be strong . strong ! what a good teacher he had been -- one of the rare kind that not onli said thing interest but also said them so that you never forgot . how bad she had learn ! she stroll on through eighth street , across third avenu and into second avenu . it was ten o'clock . the effect of the liquor she had drunk had worn away . in so much wander she had acquir the habit of close up an episod of life as a travel put behind him the railway journey at it end . she was less than half an hour from her life in the tenderloin ; it was as complet in her past as it would ever be . the card had onc more been shuffl ; a new deal was on . a new deal . what ? to fli to anoth citi -- that meant anoth palmer , or the miseri of the unprotect woman of the street , or slaveri to the madman of what the french with cruel ironi call a _maison de joie_ . to return to work -- -- what was open to her , educ as the comfort class educ their women ? work meant the tenement . she loath the fast life , but not as she loath vermin-infect tenement . to toil all day at a monoton task , the same task everi day and all day long ! to sleep at night with tucker and the vermin ! to her notion the sight and sound and smell and person contact of the tenement were no less vicious ; were -- for her at least -- far more degrad than anyth in the tenderloin and it like . and there she got money to buy whiskey that whirl her almost endur , sometim even gayli , over the worst thing -- money to buy hour , whole day of respit that could be spent in book , in dream and plan , in the freedom of a clean and comfort room , or at the theater or concert . there were degre in horror ; she was pay a hate price , but not so hate as she had paid when she work . the wage of shame were not so hard earn as the wage of toil , were larger , brought her mani of the thing she crave . the wage of toil brought her noth but the right to bare exist in filth and deprav and dark . also , she felt that if she were tie down to some dull and exhaust employ , she would be settl and done for . in a few year she would be an old woman , with less wage or flung out diseas or maim -- to live on and on like hundr of wretch old creatur adrift everywher in the tenement street . no , work had noth to offer her except `` respect . '' and what a mock was `` respect , '' in rag and filth ! besid , what had _she_ , the outcast born , to do with this respect ? no -- not work -- never again . so long as she was rove about , there was hope and chanc somehow to break through into the triumphant class that rule the world , that did the thing worth while -- wore the good cloth , live in the good hous , ate the good food , bask in the sunshin of art . either she would soar abov respect , or she would remain beneath it . respect might be an excel thing ; sure there must be some merit in a thing about which there was so much talk , after which there was so much hanker , and to which there was such desper cling . but as a sole possess , as a sole ambit , it seem thin and poor and even piti . she had emancip herself from it tyranni ; she would not resum the yoke . among so mani lack of the good thing of life it good would not be miss . perhap , when she had got a few other of the good thing she might tri to add it to them -- or might find herself abl to get comfort along without it , as had georg eliot and aspasia , georg sand and duse and bernhardt and so mani of the world 's compani of self-elect women member of the triumphant class . a new deal ! and a new deal meant at least even chanc for good luck . as she drift down the west side of second avenu , her thought so absorb her that she was oblivi of the slushi sidewalk , even of the cross where one had to pick one 's way as through a shallow creek with step stone here and there . there were mani women alon , as in everi other avenu and everi frequent cross street throughout the citi -- women made eager to desper by the long stretch of imposs weather . everi pass man was hail , sometim bold , sometim soft . again and again that grotesqu phrase `` let 's go have a good time '' fell upon the ear . after sever block , when her absent-minded had got her leg wet to the knee in the shallow shini slush , she was rous by the sound of music -- an orchestra play and play well a live hungarian danc . she was stand befor the winter garden from which the sound came . as she open the door she was greet by a rush of warm air pleasant scent with fresh tobacco smoke , the odor of spice drink and of food , pastri predomin . some of the tabl were cover readi for those who would wish to eat ; but mani of them were for the drinker . the larg , low-ceiling room was comfort fill . there were but a few women and they seem to be wive or sweetheart . susan was about to retreat when a waiter -- one of those austrian whose head end abrupt an inch or so abov the eyebrow and whose chin soon shade off into neck -- advanc smile with a polit , `` we serv ladi without escort . '' she chose a tabl that had sever other vacant tabl round it . on the recommend of the waiter she order a `` burn devil '' ; he assur her she would find it delici and the veri thing for a cold slushi night . at the far end of the room on a low platform sat the orchestra . a man in an even suit mani size too larg for him sang in a strong , not disagre tenor a german song that drew loud applaus at the end of each stanza . the `` burn devil '' came -- an almost black mixtur in a larg heavi glass . the waiter touch a match to it , and it was at onc wreath in pale flicker flame that hover like butterfli , now rise as if to float away , now light descend to flit over the surfac of the liquid or to danc along the edg of the glass . `` what shall i do with it ? '' said susan . `` wait till it goe out , '' said the waiter . `` then drink , as you would anyth els . '' and he was off to attend to the want of a group of card player a few feet away . susan touch her finger to the glass , when the flame sudden vanish . she found it was not too hot to drink , touch her lip to it . the tast , sweetish , suggest of coffe and of brandi and of burnt sugar , was agreeabl . she slowli sip it , delight in the sensat of warmth , of comfort , of well be that speedili diffus through her . the waiter came to receiv her thank for his advic . she said to him : '' do you have women sing , too ? '' `` oh , yes -- when we can find a good-look with a voic . our custom know music . '' `` i wonder if i could get a trial ? '' the waiter was interest at onc . `` perhap . you sing ? '' `` i have sung on the stage . '' `` i ll ask the boss . '' he went to the counter near the door where stood a short thick-set jew of the east european snub-nos type in earnest convers with a seat blond woman . she show that skill at cling to youth which among the lower middl and lower class pretti clear indic at least some experi at the fast life . for onli in the upper and upper middl class doe a respect woman ventur thus to advertis so suspici a guest within as a desir to be agreeabl in the sight of men . susan watch the waiter as he spoke to the proprietor , saw the proprietor 's impati shake of the head , sent out a wave of gratitud from her heart when her waiter friend persist , compel the proprietor to look toward her . she affect an air of unconsci ; in fact , she was pose as if befor a camera . her heart leap when out of the corner of her eye she saw the proprietor come with the waiter . the two paus at her tabl , and the proprietor said in a sharp , impati voic : '' well , ladi -- what is it ? '' `` i want a trial as a singer . '' the proprietor was scan her featur and her figur which was well display by the tight-fit jacket . the result seem satisfactori , for in a voic oili with the soften influenc of feminin charm upon male , he said : '' you ve had experi ? '' `` yes -- a lot of it . but i have n't sung in about two year . '' `` sing german ? '' `` onli ballad in english . but i can learn anyth . '' `` english ll do -- _if_ you can _sing_ . what costum do you wear ? '' and the proprietor seat himself and motion the waiter away . `` i have no costum . as i told you , i ve not been sing late . '' `` we ve got one that might fit -- a short blue silk skirt -- low neck and blue stock . slipper too , but they might be tight -- i forget the number . '' `` i did wear three . but i ve done a great deal of walk . i wear a five now . '' susan thrust out a foot and ankl , for she knew that despit the oversho they were good to look at . the proprietor nod approv and there was the note of person interest in his voic as he said : `` they can tri your voic tomorrow morn . come at ten o'clock . '' `` if you decid to tri me , what pay will i get ? '' the proprietor smile slyli . `` oh , we do n't pay anyth to the singer . that man who sang -- he get his board here . he work in a factori as a bookkeep in the daytim . lot of theatric and music peopl come here . if a man or a girl can do ani stunt worth while , there 's a chanc . '' `` i 'd have to have someth more than board , '' said susan . the proprietor frown down at his stubbi finger whose black and crack nail were drum on the tabl . `` well -- i might give you a bed . there 's a place i could put one in my daughter 's room . she sing and danc over at loui blanc garden in third avenu . yes , i could put you there . but -- no privileg , you understand . '' `` certain . . . . i ll decid tomorrow . mayb you ll not want me . '' `` oh , yes -- if you can sing at all . your look 'd pleas my custom . '' see the dubious express in susan 's face , he went on , `` when i say no privileg ' i mean onli about the room . of cours , it 's none of my busi what you do outsid . lot of well fix gent come here . my girl have all had good luck . i ve been open two year , and in that time one of my singer got an eleg delicatessen owner to keep her . '' `` realli , '' said susan , in the tone that was plain expect of her . `` yes -- an _elegant_ gentleman . i 'd not be surpris if he marri her . and anoth marri an electrician that cop out forti a week . you ll find it a splendid chanc to make nice friend -- good spender . and i 'm a practic man . '' `` i suppos there is n't ani work i could do in the daytim ? '' `` not here . '' `` perhap -- -- '' '' not nowher , so far as i know . that is , work you 'd care to do . the factori and store is hard on a woman , and she don't get much . and besid they ai n't veri classi to my notion . of cours , if a woman ai n't got look or sens or ani tone to her , if she 's satisfi to live in a bum tenement and marri some dub that ca n't make noth , whi , that 's differ . but you look like a woman that had been use to someth and want to get somewher . i would n't have let _my_ daughter go into no such low , foolish life . '' she had intend to ask about a place to stop for the night . she now decid that the suggest that she was homeless might possibl impair her chanc . after some further convers -- the proprietor repeat what he had alreadi said , and repeat it in about the same languag -- she paid the waiter fifteen cent for the drink and a tip of five cent out of the chang she had in her purs , and depart . it had cloud over , and a misti , dismal rain was trickl through the satur air to add to the messi of the churn of cold slush . susan went on down second avenu . on a corner near it lower end she saw a rain law hotel with awn , indic that it was not mere a blind to give a saloon a hotel licens but was actual open for busi . she went into the '' famili '' entranc of the saloon , was alon in a small clean sitting-room with a slide window between it and the bar . a tough but not unpleas young face appear at the window . it was the bartend . `` even , cuti , '' said he . `` what ll you have ? '' `` some rye whiskey , '' repli susan . `` may i smoke a cigarett here ? '' `` sure , go as far as you like . ten-cent whiskey -- or fifteen ? '' `` fifteen -- unless it 's out of the same bottl as the ten . '' `` call it ten -- see as you are a ladi . i ve got a soft heart for you ladi . i ve got a wife in the busi , myself . '' when he came in at the door with the drink , a young man follow him -- a good-look , darkish youth , well dress in a readi made suit of the best sort . at second glanc susan saw that he was at least part of jewish blood , enough to elev his face abov the rather dull type which predomin among clerk and merchant of the christian race . he had small , shifti eye , an attract smile , a manner of assur border on insol . he drop into a chair at susan tabl with a , `` you do n't mind have a drink on me . '' as susan had no money to spare , she acquiesc . she said to the bartend , `` i want to get a room here -- a plain room . how much ? '' `` mayb this gent ll help you out , '' said the bartend with a grin and a wink . `` he 's got money to burn -- and burn it . '' the bartend withdrew . the young man struck a match and held it for her to light the cigarett she took from her purs . then he lit one himself . `` next time tri one of mine , '' said he . `` i get em of a fellow that make for the swellest uptown hous . but i get em ten cent a packag instead of forti . i have n't seen you down here befor . what a good skin you'v got ! it 's been a long time sinc i ve seen a skin as fine as that , except on a babi now and then . and that shape of your is all right , too . i suppos it 's the real good ? '' with that he lean across the tabl and put his hand upon her bosom . she drew back indiffer . `` you do n't give anyth for noth -- eh ? '' laugh he . `` been in the busi long ? '' `` it seem long . '' `` it ai n't what it use to be . the competit 's get to be someth fierc . look as if all the respect girl and most of the marri women were come out to look for a littl extra money . well -- whi not ? '' susan shrug her shoulder . `` whi not ? '' echo she careless . she did not look forward with pleasur to be alon . the man was clean and well dress , and had an unusu amount of person charm that soften his impertin of manner . evid he has the habit of success with women . she much prefer him sit with her to her own depress societi . so she accept his invit . she took one of his cigarett , and it was as good as he had said . he rattl on , mingl frank coars compliment with talk about `` the busi '' from a standpoint so practic that she began to suspect he was somehow in it himself . he clear belong to those more intellig children of the upper class tenement peopl , the children who are too bright and too well educ to becom work men and work women like their parent ; they refus to do ani kind of manual labor , as it could never in the most favor circumst pay well enough to give them the higher comfort they crave , the expens comfort which everi merchant is insist and tempt thrust at a public for the most part too poor to buy ; so these clever children of the work class develop into shyster lawyer , politician , sport , prostitut , unless chanc throw into their way some respect mean of get money . vagu she wonder -- without care to question or guess what particular form of activ this young man had taken in avoid monoton work at small pay . after her second drink came she found that she did not want it . she felt tire and sleepi and wish to get her wet stock off and to dri her skirt which , for all her care hold up , had not escap the fate of whatev was expos to that abomin night . `` i 'm go along with you , '' said the young man as she rose . `` here 's to our better acquaint . '' `` thank , but i want to be alon , '' repli she affabl . and , not to seem unappreci of his courtesi , she took a small drink from her glass . it tast veri queer . she glanc suspici at the young man . her leg grew sudden and strang heavi . her heart began to beat violent , and a black fog seem to be close in upon her eye . through it she saw the youth grin sardon . and instant she knew . `` what a fool i am ! '' she thought . she had been trap by anoth form of the slave system . this man was a recruit sergeant for hous of prostitut -- was one of the `` cadet . '' they search the tenement district for good-look girl and young women . they hang about the street corner , flirt . they attend the ball where go the young peopl of the lower middl class and upper lower class . they learn to make love seduct ; they understand how to tempt a girl 's long for fineri , for an easier life , her dream of a husband abov her class in look and in earn power . and for each recruit `` broken in '' and harden to the point of willing to go into a sport hous , they get from the proprietor ten to twenty-f dollar accord to her youth and beauti . susan knew all about the system , had heard stori of it from the lip of girl who had been embark through it -- embark a littl sooner than they would have embark under the lash of want , or of that other and almost equal compel brute , desir for the comfort and luxuri that mean decent live . susan knew ; yet here she was , becaus of an unguard moment , and becaus of a sens of secur through experi -- here she was , succumb to knockout drop as easili as the most innoc child lure away from it mother 's door to get a saucer of ice cream ! she tri to rise , to scream , though she knew ani such effort was futil . with a gasp and a sigh her head fell forward and she was unconsci . she awaken in a small , rather dingi room . she was lie on her back with onli stock on . beyond the foot of the bed was a littl bureau at which a man , back full to her , stood in trouser and shirt sleev tie his neckti . she saw that he was a rough look man , coars dress -- an artisan or small shop-keep . use as she was to the profound indiffer of men of all class and degre of educ and intellig to what the woman thought -- use as she was to this sensual selfish which men at least in part conceal from their respect wive , susan felt a horror of this man who had not mind her unconsci . her head was ach so fierc that she had not the courag to move . present the man turn toward her a kind , beard face . but she was use to the man of general good charact who with littl shame and no hesit becam beast befor her , the free woman . `` hello , pretti ! '' cri he , genial . `` slept off your jag , have you ? '' he was put on his coat and waistcoat . he took from the waistcoat pocket a dollar bill . `` you re a peach , '' said he . `` i ll come again , next time my old ladi goe off guard . '' he made the bill into a pellet , drop it on her breast . `` a littl present for you . put it in your stock and do n't let the madam grab it . '' with a groan susan lift herself to a sit posit , drew the spread about her -- a gestur of instinct rather than of conscious modesti . `` they drug me and brought me here , '' said she . `` i want you to help me get out . '' `` good lord ! '' cri the man , instant all a-quiv with nervous . `` i 'm a marri man . i do n't want to get mix up in this . '' and out of the room he bolt , close the door behind him . susan smile at herself satir . after all her experi , to make this silli appeal -- she who knew men ! `` i must be get feeble-mind , '' thought she . then -- -- her cloth ! with a glanc she swept the littl room . no closet ! her own cloth gone ! on the chair besid the bed a fast-hous parlor dress of pink cotton silk , and a kind of abbrevi chemis . the stock on her leg were not her own , but were of pink cotton , silk finish . a pair of pink satin slipper stood on the floor besid the two galvan iron wash basin . the door open and a bur man , dress in cheap ready-mad cloth but with an air of author and prosper , was smile at her . `` the madam told me to walk right in and make myself at home , '' said he . `` yes , you re up to her account of you . onli she said you were dead drunk and would probabl be asleep . now , honey , you treat me right and i ll treat you right .

'' there came no direct answer to that last question . but up from those deep vast reservoir of vital that seem suffici whatev the drain upon them -- up from those reservoir well strength and that unfalt will to live which breath upon the corps of hope and quicken it . and she had a sens of an invis be , a power that had her in charg , a destini , walk besid her , hold up her droop strength , compel her toward some goal hidden in the fog and the storm . at eighth street she turn west ; at third avenu she paus , wait for chanc to direct her . was it not like the malici of fate that in the citi whose rare interrupt reign of joyous sunshin made her call it the citi of the sun her critic turn of chanc should have fallen in foul weather ? evid fate was resolv on a thorough test of her endur . in the open squar , near the peter cooper statu , stood a huge all-night lunch wagon . she move toward it , for she sudden felt hungri . it was drawn to the curb ; a short flight of ladder step led to an interior attract to sight and smell . she halt at the foot of the step and look in . the onli occup was the man in charg . in a white coat he was lean upon the counter , read a newspap which lay flat upon it . his bent head was extens and rough thatch with black hair so thick that to draw a comb through it would have been all but imposs . as susan let down her umbrella and began to ascend , he lift his head and gave her a full view of a humor young face , bushi of eyebrow and mustach and dark stain by his beard , close shaven though it was . he look like a spaniard or an italian , but he was a black irishman , one of the west coaster who recal in their eye and color the wreck of the armada . `` good morn , ladi , '' said he . `` breakfast or supper ? '' `` both , '' repli susan . `` i 'm starv . '' the air was grate warm in the littl restaur on wheel . the domin odor was of hot coffe ; but that aroma was carri to a still higher delight by a suggest of pastri . `` the best thing i ve got , '' said the restaur man , `` is hot corn beef hash . it 's so good i hate to let ani of it go . you can have griddl cake , too -- and coffe , of cours . '' `` veri well , '' said susan . she was ascend upon a wave of reaction from the event of the night . her headach had gone . the rain beat upon the roof seem music to her now , in this warm shelter with it certainti of the food she crave . the young man was busi at the shini , compact stove ; the odor of the good thing she was present to have grew stronger and stronger , stimul her hunger , bring joy to her heart and a smile to her eye . she wonder at herself . after what she had pass through , how could she feel thus happi -- yes , posit happi ? it seem to her this was an indic of a lack in her somewher -- of serious , of sensibl , of she knew not what . she ought to be asham of that lack . but she was not asham . she was shed her troubl like a child -- or like a philosoph . `` do you like hash ? '' inquir the restaur man over his shoulder . `` just as you re make it , '' said she . `` dri but not too dri . brown but not too brown . '' `` you do n't think you 'd like a poach egg on top of it ? '' `` exact what i want ! '' `` it is n't everybodi that can poach an egg , '' said the restaur man . `` and it is n't everi egg that can be poach . now , my egg are the real thing . and i can poach em so you 'd think they was done with one of them poach machin . i do n't have em with the yellow on a slab of white . i do it so that the white 's all round the yellow , like in the shell . and i keep em tender , too . did you say one egg or a pair ? '' `` two , '' said susan . the dish were thick , but clean and whole . the hash -- '' dri but not too dri , brown but not too brown '' -- was artist arrang on it platter , and the two egg that adorn it top were precis as he had promis . the coffe , boil with the milk , was real coffe , too . when the restaur man had set these thing befor her , as she sat expect on a stool , he view his handiwork with admir eye . `` delmonico could n't beat it , '' said he . `` no , nor oscar , neither . that ll take the tire look out of your face , ladi , and bring the beauti back . '' susan ate slowli , listen to the music of the beat rain . it was like an oasi , a rest halt between two stretch of desert journey ; she wish to make it as long as possibl . onli those who live expos to life 's buffet ever learn to enjoy to the full the great littl pleasur of life -- the halcyon paus in the storm -- the few bright ray through the break in the cloud , the joy of food after hunger , of a bath after day of privat , of a jest or a smile face or a kind word or deed after dark and bitter and contempt . she saw the restaur man 's eye on her , a curious express in them . `` what 's the matter ? '' she inquir . `` i was think , '' said he , `` how miser you must have been to be so happi now . '' `` oh , i guess none of us has ani too easi a time , '' said she . `` but it 's mighti hard on women . i use to think differ , befor i had bad luck and got down to tend this lunch wagon . but now i understand about a lot of thing . it 's all veri well for comfort peopl to talk about what a man or a woman ought to do and ought n't to do . but let em be slam up against it . they 'd sing a differ song -- would n't they ? '' `` quit differ , '' said susan . the man wave a griddl spoon . `` i tell you , we do what we'v got to do . yes -- the thiev and -- and -- all of us . some 's use for foundat and some for roof and some for insid fanci work and some for outsid wall . and some 's use for the rubbish heap . but all 's use . they do what they ve got to do . i was a great hand at worri what i was go to be use for . but i do n't bother about it ani more . '' he began to pour the griddl cake dough . `` i think i ll get there , though , '' said he dog , as if he expect to be derid for vaniti . `` you will , '' said susan . `` i 'm twenty-nin . but i ve been be got readi for someth . they do n't chip away at a stone as they have at me without intend to make some use of it . '' `` no , inde , '' said the girl , hope and faith well up in her own heart . `` and what 's more , i ve stood the chip . i ai n't becom rubbish ; i 'm still a good stone . that 's promis , ai n't it ? '' `` it 's a sure sign , '' declar susan . sure for herself , no less than for him . the restaur man took from under the counter sever well-worn schoolbook . he held them up , look at susan and wink . `` good busi -- eh ? '' she laugh and nod . he put the book back under the counter , finish the cake and serv them . as he gave her more butter he said : '' it ai n't the best butter -- not by a long shot . but it good -- as good as you get on the averag farm -- or better . did you ever eat the best butter ? '' `` i do n't know . i ve had some that was veri good . '' `` eighti cent a pound ? '' `` merci , no , '' exclaim susan . `` aw price , is n't it ? but worth the money -- yes , sir ! some time when you ve got a littl chang to spare , go get half a pound at one of the swell groceri or dairi . and the best milk , too . twelv cent a quart . wait till i get money . i'll show em how to live . i was born in a tenement . never had noth . rag to wear , and food one notch abov a garbag barrel . '' `` i know , '' said susan . `` but even as a boy i want the high-class thing . it want the best that make a man push his way up . '' anoth custom came -- a keeper of a butcher shop , on his way to market . susan finish the cake , paid the forti cent and prepar to depart . `` i 'm look for a hotel , '' said she to the restaur man , `` one where they ll take me in at this time , but one that 's safe not a dive . '' `` right across the squar there 's a salvat armi shelter -- veri good -- clean . i do n't know of ani other place for a ladi . '' `` there 's a hotel on the next corner , '' put in the butcher , suspend the violent smack and sip which attend his take roll and coffe . `` it ai n't neither the one thing nor the other . it 's clean and cheap , and they ll let you behav if you want to . '' `` that 's all i ask , '' said the girl . `` thank you . '' and she depart , after an exchang of friend glanc with the restaur man . `` i feel lot better , '' said she . `` it was a good breakfast , '' repli he . `` that was onli part . good luck ! '' `` same to you , ladi . call again . tri my chop . '' at the corner the butcher had indic susan found the usual rain law hotel , adjunct to a saloon and open to all comer , howev `` transient . '' but she took the butcher 's word for it , engag a dollar-and-a-half room from the half-asleep clerk , was shown to it by a color bellboy who did not bother to wake up . it was a nice littl room with bare space enough for a bed , a bureau , a stationari washstand , a chair and a small radiat . as she undress by the light of a sad gray dawn , she examin her dress to see how far it need repair and how far it might be repair . she had worn away from forty-third street her cheapest dress becaus it happen to be of an inconspicu blue . it was one of those suit that look fair well at a glanc on the wax figur in the depart store window , that lose their bloom as quick as a countri bride , and at the fourth or fifth wear begin to make frank and sweep confess of the cheap of everi bit of the materi and labor that went into them . these suit are typic of all that poverti compel upon the poor , all that they in their ignor and inexperi of valu accept without complaint , fanci they are get money 's worth and never dream they are more extravag than the most prodig of the rich . howev , as their poverti give them no choic , their ignor save them from futil of angri discont . susan had bought this dress becaus she had to have anoth dress and could not afford to spend more than twelv dollar , and it had been mark down from twenty-f . she had worn it in fair weather and had contriv to keep it look pretti well . but this rain had finish it quit . thereaft , until she could get anoth dress , she must expect to be class as poor and seedi -- therefor , on the way toward deeper poverti -- therefor , an object of piti and of prey . if she went into a shop , she would be treat insult by the shopgirl , despis her as a poor creatur like themselv . if a man approach her , he would calcul upon get her veri cheap becaus a girl in such a costum could not have been in the habit of receiv ani great sum . and if she went with him , he would treat her with far less consider than if she had been about the same busi in smarter attir . she spread the dress on bureau and chair , smooth it , wipe the mud stain from it . she wash out her stock at the stationari stand , got them as dri as her remark strong hand could wring them , hung them on a rung of the chair near the hot littl radiat . she clean her boot and oversho with an old newspap she found in a drawer , and wet at the washstand . she took her hat to piec and made it over into someth that look almost fresh enough to be new . then , readi for bed , she got the offic of the hotel on the telephon and left a call for half-past nine o'clock -- three hour and a half away . when she was throw up the window , she glanc into the street . the rain had onc more ceas . through the gray dim the men and women , boy and girl , on the way to the factori and shop for the day 's work , were stream past in funer process . some of the young one were live . but the mass was sullen and dreari . bodi wreck or rapid wreck by ignor of hygien , by the foul air and foul food of the tenement , by the monoton toil of factori and shop -- mindless toil -- toil that took away mind and put in it place a distast for all improv -- toil of the factori that distort the bodi and envelop the soul in sodden stupid -- toil of the shop that meant breath bad air all day long , meant stoop shoulder and varicos vein in the leg and the arch of the instep broken down , meant dull eye , bad skin , femal complaint , meant the breed of desir for the luxuri the shop display , the breed of envi and servil toward those abl to buy these luxuri . susan linger , fascin by this exhibit of the price to the mani of civil for the few . work ? never ! not ani more than she would . `` work '' in a dive ! work -- either branch of it , factori and shop or dive meant the sale of all the bodi and all the soul ; her profess -- at least as she practic it -- meant that perhap she could buy with part of bodi and part of soul the privileg of keep the rest of both for her own self . if she had stay on at work from the begin in cincinnati , where would she be now ? live in some stink tenement hole , with hope dead . and how would she be look ? as dull of eye as the rest , as pasti and mottl of skin , as readi for ani chanc diseas . work ? never ! never ! `` not at anyth that'd degrad me more than this life . yes -- more . '' and she lift her head defiant . to her hunger life was thus far offer onli a plate of rotten appl ; it was difficult to choos among them -- but there was choic . she was awaken by the telephon bell ; and it kept on ring until she got up and spoke to the offic through the sender . never had she so crave sleep ; and her mental and physic content of three hour and a half befor had been succeed by headach , a general sore , a horribl attack of the blue . she grew somewhat better , howev , as she wash first in hot water , then in cold at the stationari stand which was quit as effici if not so luxuri as a bathtub . she dress in a rush , but not so hurri that she fail to make the best toilet the circumst permit . her hair went up unusu well ; the dress did not look so bad as she had fear it would . `` as it 's a nasti day , '' she reflect , `` it won't do me so much damag . my hat and my boot will make them give me the benefit of the doubt and think i 'm save my good cloth . '' she pass through the offic at five minut to ten . when she reach lang 's winter garden , it clock said ten minut past ten , but she knew it must be fast . onli one of the four musician had arriv -- the man who play the drum , cymbal , triangl and xylophon -- a fat , discourag old man who knew how easili he could be replac . neither lang nor his wife had come ; her origin friend , the austrian waiter , was wipe off tabl and clean match stand . he welcom her with a smile of delight that show how few teeth remain in the front of his mouth and how deepli yellow they were . but susan saw onli his eye -- and the kind heart that look through them . `` mayb you have n't had breakfast alreadi ? '' he suggest . `` i 'm not hungri , thank you . '' `` perhap some coffe -- yes ? '' susan thought the coffe would make her feel better . so he brought it -- vienna fashion -- an open china pot full of strong , delici aromat black coffe , a jug of milk with whip white of egg on top , a basket of small sweet roll powder with sugar and caraway seed . she ate one of the roll , drank the coffe . befor she had finish , the waiter stood beam befor her and said : '' a cigarett -- yes ? '' `` oh , no , '' repli susan , a littl sad . `` but yes , '' urg he . `` it is n't against the rule . the boss wife smoke . mani ladi who come here do -- real ladi . it is the custom in europ . whi not ? '' and he produc a box of cigarett and put it on the tabl . susan lit one of them and onc more with suprem physic content came a cheer that put color and sprightli into the flower of hope . and the sun had won it battl with the storm ; the storm was in retreat . sunshin was stream in at the window , into her heart . the waiter paus in his work now and then to enjoy himself in contempl the charm pictur she made . she was think of what the wagon restaur man had said . yes , life had been chip away at her ; but she had remain good stone , had not becom rubbish . about half-past ten lang came down from his flat which was overhead . he inspect her by daylight and find that his electr light impress were not delus was high pleas with her . he refus to allow her to pay for the coffe . `` johann ! '' he call , and the leader of the orchestra approach and made a respect bow to his employ . he had a solemn pompous air and the usual pompadour . he and susan plung into the music question , found that the onli song they both knew was tosti 's `` good bye . '' `` that ll do to tri , '' said lang . `` begin ! '' and after a littl tune and voic test , susan sang the '' good bye '' with full orchestra accompani . it was not good ; it was not even pretti good ; but it was not bad . `` you ll do all right , '' said lang . `` you can stay . now , you and johann fix up some song and get readi for tonight . '' and he turn away to buy suppli for restaur and bar . johann , deepli sentiment by natur , was much pleas with susan 's contralto . `` you do not know how to sing , '' said he . `` you sing in your throat and you ve got all the fault of parlor singer . but the voic is there -- and much express -- much tempera . also , you have intellig -- and that will make a veri littl voic go a great way . '' befor proceed ani further with the rehears , he took susan up to a shop where sheet music was sold and they select three simpl song : `` gipsi queen , '' `` star of my life '' and `` love in dream . '' they were to tri `` gipsi queen '' that night , with `` good bye '' and , if the applaus should compel , `` suwane river . '' when they were back at the restaur susan seat herself in a quiet corner and proceed to learn the word of the song and to get some notion of the tune . she had lunch with mr. and mrs. lang and kati , whose hair was veri golden inde and whose voic and manner proclaim the boweri and it vaudevill stage . she began by be grand with susan , but had far too good a heart and far too sensibl a natur to keep up long . it take more vaniti , more solemn stupid and more leisur than plain peopl have time for , to maintain the forc of fake digniti . befor lunch was over it was kati and lorna ; and kati was distress that her duti at the theater made it imposs for her to stay and help lorna with the song . at the afternoon rehears susan distinguish herself . to permit busi in the restaur and the rehears at the same time , there was a curtain to divid the big room into two unequ part . when susan sang her song through for the first time complet , the men smoke and drink on the other side of the curtain burst into applaus . johann shook hand with susan , shook hand again , kiss her hand , pat her shoulder . but in the even thing did not go so well . susan , bad frighten , got away from the orchestra , lag when it speed to catch up with her . she made a pretti and engag figur in the costum , low in the neck and end at the knee . her face and shoulder , her arm and leg , the line of her slender , round bodi made a success . but they bare save her from be laugh at . when she finish , there was no applaus so no necess for an encor . she ran upstair , and , with nerv all a-quiv , hid herself in the littl room she and kati were to share . until she fail she did not realiz how much she had stake upon this ventur . but now she knew ; and it seem to her that her onli futur was the street . again her chanc had come ; again she had thrown it away . if there were anyth in her -- anyth but mere vain hope -- that could not have occur . in her plight anyon with a spark of the divin that achiev success would have score . `` i belong in the street , '' said she . befor dinner she had gone out and had bought a ninety-f cent night-dress and some toilet articl . these she now bundl togeth again . she chang to her street dress ; she stole down the stair . she was out at the side door , she was fli through the side street toward the boweri . `` hi ! '' shout someon behind her . `` where you go ? '' and overtak her came her staunch friend albert , the waiter . feel that she must need sympathi and encourag , he had slip away from his duti to go up to her . he had reach the hall in time to see what she was about and had dart barehead after her . `` where you go ? '' he repeat , excit . a crowd began to gather . `` oh , good-bi , '' she cri . `` i'm get out befor i 'm told to go -- that 's all . i made a failur . thank you , albert . '' she put out her hand ; she was still move and look in the direct of the boweri . `` now you must n't be foolish , '' , said he , hold on tight to her hand . `` the boss say it 's all right . tomorrow you do better . '' `` i 'd never dare tri again . '' `` tomorrow make everyth all right . you must n't act like a babi . the first time kati tri , they yell her off the stage . now she get eleven a week . come back right away with me . the boss 'd be mad if you wo n't . you ai n't act right , miss lorna . i did n't think you was such a fool . '' he had her attent now . unmind of the littl crowd they had gather , they stood there discuss until to save albert from pneumonia she return with him . he saw her start up the stair , then ventur to take his eye off her long enough to put his head into the winter garden and send a waiter for lang . he stood guard until lang came and was on his way to her . the next even , a saturday , befor a crowd hous she sang well , as well as she had ever sung in her life -- sang well enough to give her beauti of face and figur , her sweet , her charm the opportun to win a success . she had to come back and sing `` suwane river . '' she had to come for a second encor ; and , flush with her victori over her timid , she sang tosti 's sad cri of everlast farewel with all the tender there was in her . that song exact fit her passion , melancholi voic ; it word harmon with the deep sad that was her real self , that is the real self of everi sensit soul this world has ever tri with it exquisit torment for flesh and spirit . the tear that can not be shed were in her voic , in her face , as she stood there , with her violet-gray eye strain into vacanc . but the men and the women shed tear ; and when she move , break the spell of silenc , they not onli applaud , they cheer . the news quick spread that at lang 's there was a girl singer worth hear and still more worth look at . and lang had his opportun to arriv . but sever thing stood in his way , thing a man of far more intellig would have found it hard to overcom . like near all saloon-keep , he was serf to a breweri ; and the particular breweri whose beer his mortgag compel him to push did not make a beer that could be push . peopl complain that it had a disagre bitter aftertast . in the second place , mrs. lang was a born sitter . she had marri to rest -- and she was rest . she was alway pile upon a chair . thus , she was not an aid but a hindranc , an encourag of the help in lazi and slovenli . again , the cook was distinct bad ; the onli realli good thing the hous serv was coffe , and that was good onli in the morn . final , lang was a saver by natur and not a spreader . he could hold tight to ani money he close his stubbi finger upon ; he did not know how to plant money and make it grow , but onli how to hoard . thus it came to pass that , after the first spurt , the busi fell back to about where it had been befor susan came . albert , the austrian waiter , explain to susan whi it was that her popular did the hous appar so littl good -- explain with truth where she suspect kind-heart plot , that she had arrest it latter swift-downward slide . she was glad to hear what he had to say , as it was most pleasant to her vaniti ; but she could not get over the depress of the central fact -- she was not make the sort of busi to justifi ask lang for more than board and lodg ; she was not in the way of make the money that was each day more necessari , as her littl store dwindl . the question of get money to live on is usual dismiss in a princ way by writer about human life . it is in realiti , except with the few rich , the ever-pres question -- as ever-pres as the necess of breath -- and it is not , like breath , a matter settl automat . it domin thought ; it determin action . to leav it out of account ever , in write a human histori , is to misrepres and distort as utter as would a portrait painter who neglect to give his subject eye , or a head , even . with the overwhelm mass of us , money is at all time all our live long the paramount question -- for to be without it is destruct wors than death , and we are almost all peril near to be without it . thus , airili to pass judgment upon men and women as to their do in get money for necessari , for what the compuls of custom and habit has made necessari to them -- airili to judg them for their do in such dire strait is like sit calm on shore and critic the conduct of passeng and sailor in a storm-beset sink ship . it is one of the favorit pastim of the comfort class ; it make an excel impress as to one 's virtu upon one 's audienc ; it give us a pleas sens of superior delicaci and humor . but it is none the less mean and ridicul . instead of condemn , the world need to bestir itself to remov the stupid and cruel creatur that make evil conduct necessari ; for can anyon , not a prig , say that the small part of the human race that doe well doe so becaus it is natur better than the larg part that doe ill ? spring was slow in open . susan 's one dress was in a deplor state . the line hung in rag . the never good materi was stretch out of shape , was fray and worn gray in spot , was beyond be made up as present by the most care press and clean . she had been forc to buy a hat , shoe , undercloth . she had onli three dollar and a few cent left , and she simpli did not dare lay it all out in dress materi . yet , less than all would not be enough ; all would not be enough . lang had from time to time more than hint at the opportun she was have as a public singer in his hall . but susan , for all her experi , had remain one of those upon whom such opportun must be thrust if they are to be accept . so long as she had food and shelter , she could not make advanc ; she could not even go so far as passiv acquiesc . she knew she was again violat the fundament canon of success ; whatev one 's busi , do it thorough if at all . but she could not overcom her tempera which had at this feebl and fals opportun at onc resent itself . she knew perfect that therein was the whole caus of her failur to make the success she ought to have made when she came up from the tenement , and again when she fell into the clutch of freddi palmer . but it is one thing to know ; it is anoth thing to do . susan ignor the attempt of the men ; she pretend not to understand lang when they set him on to interced with her for them . she saw that she was onc more drift to disast -- and that she had not long to drift . she was exasper against herself ; she was disgust with herself . but she drift on . grow seedier look everi day , she wait , defi the plain teach of experi . she even thought serious of go to work . but the situat in that direct remain unchang . she was see thing , the reason for thing , more clear now , as experi develop her mind . she felt that to get on in respect she ought to have been either more or less educ . if she had been use from birth to condit but a step remov from savageri , she might have been content with what offer , might even have felt that she was rise . or if she had been bred to a good trade , and educ onli to the point where her small earn could have satisfi her desir , then she might have got along in respect . but she had been bred a `` ladi '' ; a chines woman whose feet have been bound from babyhood until her fifteenth or sixteenth year -- how long it would be , after her feet were freed , befor she could learn to walk at all ! -- and would she ever be abl to learn to walk well ? what is luxuri for one is squalor for anoth ; what is elev for one degrad anoth . in respect she could not earn what was barest necess for her -- what she was now get at lang 's -- decent shelter , passabl food . eject from her own class that shelter it women and bring them up in unfit for the unshelt life , she was drop as all such women must and do drop -- was go down , down , down -- strike on this ledg and that , and rebound to resum her ever downward cours . she saw her own plight onli too vivid . those whose outward and inward live are wide apart get a strong sens of dual person . it was thus with susan . there were time when she could not believ in the realiti of her extern life . she often glanc through the column on column , page on page of `` want ad '' in the paper -- not with the idea of answer them , for she had serv her apprenticeship at that , but simpli to forc herself to realiz vivid just how matter stood with her . those column and page of close print offer of work ! dreari task , all of them -- task devoid of interest , of person sens of use , task simpli to keep degrad soul in degener bodi , task perform in filthi factori , in foul-smel workroom and shop , in unhealth surround . and this , throughout civil , was the '' honest work '' so prais -- by all who do n't do it , but live pleasant by make other do it . was n't there someth in the idea of etta 's father , old tom brashear ? couldn't sensibl , realli love peopl devis some way of make most task less repuls , of lessen the burden of those task that could n't be anyth but repuls ? was this stupid system , so cruel , so crush , and produc at the top such absurd result as flashi , insol auto and silli palac and overf , overdress women , and dog in jewel collar , and babi of wealth brought up by low menial -- was this system realli the best ? `` if they 'd stop cant about honest work ' they might begin to get somewher . '' in the effort to prevent her downward drop from begin again she search all the occup open to her . she could not find one that would not have meant onli the most visionari prospect of some slight remot advanc , and the certain and speedi destruct of what she now realiz was her chief asset and hope -- her person appear . and she resolv that she would not even endang it ever again . the largest part of the littl capit she took away from forty-third street had gone to a dentist who put in sever fill of her back teeth . she had learn to valu everi charm -- hair , teeth , eye , skin , figur , hand . she watch over them all , becaus she felt that when her day final came -- and come it would , she never allow long to doubt -- she must be readi to enter fulli into her own . her day ! the day when fate should chang the life her outward self would be compel to live , would bring it into harmoni with the life of inward self -- the self she could control . kati had struck up a friendship at onc profit and sentiment with her stage manag . she often stay out all night . on one of these night susan , alon in the tini room and asleep , was rous by feel hand upon her . she start up half awak and scream . `` sh ! '' came in lang 's voic . `` it 's me . '' susan had latter observ sli attempt on his part to make advanc without his wife and daughter 's suspect ; but she had thought her way of quiet ignor was effect . `` you must go , '' she whisper . `` mrs. lang must have heard . '' `` i had to come , '' said he hoars , a mere voic in the dark . `` i ca n't hold out no longer without you , lorna . '' `` go -- go , '' urg susan . but it was too late . in the doorway , candl in hand , appear mrs. lang . despit her effort at `` dressi '' she was in her best hour home and near shapeless . in night dress and releas from corset she was hideous and monstrous . `` i thought so ! '' she shriek . `` i thought so ! '' `` i heard a burglar , mother , '' whine lang , an abject and guilti figur . `` shut your mouth , you loafer ! '' shriek mrs. lang . and she turn to susan . `` you gutter hussi , get on your cloth and clear out ! '' `` but -- mrs. lang -- -- '' began susan . `` clear out ! '' she shout , open the outer hall . `` dress mighti damn quick and clear out ! '' `` mother , you ll wake the peopl upstair , '' plead lang -- and susan had never befor realiz how afraid of his wife the littl man was . `` for god 's sake , listen to sens . '' `` after i ve thrown you -- into the street , '' cri his wife , besid herself with jealous furi . `` get dress , i tell you ! '' she shout at susan . and the girl hurri into her cloth , make no further attempt to speak . she knew that to plead and to explain would be useless ; even if mrs. lang believ , still she would drive from the hous the temptat to her husband . lang , in a quak , coward whine , beg his wife to be sensibl and believ his burglar stori . but with each half-dozen word he utter , she interrupt to hurl obscen epithet at him or at susan . the tenant of the upstair flat came down . she told her wrong to a dozen half-clad men , women and children ; they took her side at onc , and with the women lead shower vile insult upon susan . the uproar was rise , rise . lang cower in a corner , cri bitter like a whip child . susan , onli part dress , caught up her hat and rush into the hall . sever women struck at her as she pass . she stumbl on the stair , almost fell headlong . with the most fright word in tenement hous vocabulari pursu her she fled into the street , and did not paus until she was within a few yard of the boweri . there she sat down on a doorstep and , half-craz by the horror of her sudden downfal , lace her shoe and button her blous and put on her hat with fumbl , shake finger . it had all happen so quick that she would have thought she was dream but for the cold night air and the dingi wast of the boweri with the streetwalk and drunken bum stroll along under the elev track . she had trifl with the opportun too long . it had flown in disgust , dislodg her as it took flight . if she would be over nice and critic , would hesit to take the onli upward path fate saw fit to offer , then -- let her seek the bottom ! susan peer down , and shudder . she went into the saloon at the corner , into the littl back room . she pour down drink after drink of the fright poison sold as whiskey with the permiss of a govern own by everi interest that can make big money out of a race of free men and so can afford to pay big bribe . it is characterist of this poison of the saloon of the tenement quarter that it produc in anyon who drink it a speci of quick insan , of immedi degener -- a desir to commit crime , to do degrad act . within an hour of susan 's be thrown into the street , no one would have recogn her . she had been drink , had been treat the two fade but young and decent dress streetwalk who sat at anoth tabl . the three , fire and madden by the poison , were amus themselv and two young men as reckless intox as they . susan , in an attitud she had seen often enough but had never dream of take , was laugh wild at a coars song , was stand up , skirt caught high and bodi sway in drunken rhythm as she led the chorus . when the barkeep announc close time , one of the young men said to her : '' which way ? '' `` to hell , '' laugh she . `` i ve been thrown out everywher els . want to go along ? '' `` i ll never desert a perfect ladi , '' repli he . chapter x she was like one who has fallen bleed and broken into a cave ; who after a time gather himself togeth and crawl toward a faint and far distant gleam of light ; who sudden see the light no more and at the same instant lurch forward and down into a deeper chasm . occasion sheer exhaust of nerv made it imposs for her to drink herself again into apathi befor the effect of the last dose of the poison had worn off . in these interv of partial awaken -- she never permit them to lengthen out , as such sensat as she had was of one fall -- fall -- through empti space -- with whirl brain and strang sound in the ear and strang distort sight or hallucin befor the eye -- fall down -- down -- whither ? -- to how great a depth ? -- or was there no bottom , but simpli present a plung on down into the black of death 's bottomless oblivion ? drink -- alway drink . yet in everi other way she took care of her health -- a strang mingl of prudenc and subtl hope with reckless and frank despair . all her refin , baffl in the moral way , concentr upon the physic . she would be neat and well dress ; she would not let herself be seiz of the diseas on the pariah in those region -- the diseas through dirt and ignor and indiffer . in the region she now frequent reckless was the keynot . there was the hilar of the doom ; there was the cynic or stolid indiffer to heat or cold , to rain or shine , to rag , to filth , to jail , to eject for nonpay of rent , to insult of word or blow . the fire engin -- the ambul -- the patrol wagon -- the citi dead wagon -- these were all ever pass and repass through those swarm street . it was the vastest , the most popul tenement area of the citi . it inhabit repres the common lot -- for it is the common lot of the overwhelm mass of mankind to live near to naked , to shelterless , to starvat , without ever be quit nake or quit roofless or quit starv . the mass are eager for the necess ; the class are eager for the comfort and luxuri . the mass are ignor ; the class are intellig -- or , at least , shrewd . the unconsci and inevit exploit of the mass by the class automat and of necess stop just short of the catastroph point -- for the mass must have enough to give them the strength to work and reproduc . to go down through the social system as had susan from her origin place well up among the class is like descend from the beauti dine room of the palac where the meat is serv in tast and refin upon cost dish by well manner servant to attract dress peopl -- descend along the various stage of the prepar of the meat , at each stage less of refin and more of coars , until one at last arriv at the slaughter pen . the shambl , stink and reek blood and filth ! the shambl , with hideous groan or shriek , or more hideous silent look of agoni ! the shambl of societi where the beauti and grace and charm of civil are creat out of noisom sweat and savag toil , out of the health and strength of men and women and children , out of their ground up bodi , out of their ground up soul . susan knew those region well . she had no theori about them , no resent against the fortun class , no notion that ani other or better system might be possibl , ani other or better life for the mass . she simpli accept life as she found it , live it as best she could . throughout the mass of mankind life is sustain by illus -- illus of a better lot tomorrow , illus of a heaven beyond a grave , where the nightmar , life in the bodi , will end and the realiti , life in the spirit , will begin . she could not join the throng move toward church and synagogu to indulg in their dream that the present was a dream from which death would be a joy awaken . she altern piti and envi them . she had her own dream that this dream , the present , would end in a joy awaken to success and freedom and light and beauti . she admit to herself that the dream was probabl an illus , like that of the pious throng . but she was as unreason tenaci of her dream as they were of their . she dream it becaus she was a human be -- and to be human mean to hope , and to hope mean to dream of a brighter futur here or hereaft , or both here and hereaft . the earth is peopl with dreamer ; she was but one of them . the last thought of despair as the black earth close is a hope , perhap the most coloss of hope 's delus , that there will be escap in the grave . there is the time when we hope and know it and believ in it . there is the time when we hope and know it but have ceas to believ in it . there is the time when we hope , believ that we have altogeth ceas to hope . that time had come for susan . she seem to think about the present . she move about like a sleepwalk . what women did she know -- what men ? she onli dim rememb from day to day -- from hour to hour . blur face pass befor her , blur voic sound in her ear , blur person touch her . it was like the jostl of a huge crowd in night street . a vagu sens of buffet -- of rude contact -- of momentari sensat of pain , of shame , of disgust , all blunt and soon forgotten . in estim suffer , physic or mental , to fail to take into account a more import factor -- the merci paralysi or partial paralysi of ani center of sensibl -- that is insist assault . she no longer had headach or nausea after drink deepli . and where former it had taken mani stiff dose of liquor to get her into the state of reckless or of indiffer , she was now abl to put herself into the mood in which life was endur with two or three drink , often with onli one . the most mark chang was that never by ani chanc did she becom gay ; the sky over her life was steadili gray -- gray or black , to gray again -- never lighter . how far she had fallen ! but swift descent or gradual , she had adapt herself -- had , in fact , learn by much experi of disast to mitig the calam , to have someth to keep a certain deep-li self of self intact -- unaffect by what she had been forc to undergo . it seem to her that if she could get the chanc -- or could cure herself of the blind which was alway prevent her from see and seiz the chanc that doubtless offer again and again -- she could shed the surfac her mode of life had form over her and would find underneath a new real surfac , stronger , sight , better abl to bear -- like the skin that form beneath the heal wound . in these tenement , as in all tenement of all degre , she and the other of her class were fierc resent by the head of famili where there was ani hope left to impel a strive upward . she had the best furnish room in the tenement . she was the best dress woman -- a mark and instant recogniz figur becaus of her neat and finer cloth . her profess kept aliv and activ the instinct for care of the person that either did not exist or were momentari and feebl in the respect women . the slovenli , the scurril of even the wive and daughter of the well-to-do and the rich of that region would not have been toler in ani but the lowest strata of her profess , hard even in those sought by men of the labor class . also , the deep horror of diseas , which her intellig never for an instant permit to relax it hold , made her particular and care when in other circumst drink might have reduc her to squalor . she spent all her leisur time -- for she no longer read -- in the care of her person . she was watch with frighten , yet long and curious , eye by all the girl who were at work . the mother hate her ; mani of them spat upon the ground after she had pass . it was a heart-break struggl , that of these mother to save their daughter , not from prostitut , not from live with men outsid marriag , not from moral danger , but from the practic danger , the danger of bring into the world children with no father to help feed and cloth them . in the opinion of these peopl -- an opinion often frank express , rare conceal with ani but the thinnest hypocrisi -- the life of prostitut was not so bad . did the life of virtu offer ani attract altern ? whether a woman was `` bad '' or `` good , '' she must live in travail and die in squalor to be buri in or near the potter 's field . but if the girl still live at home were not '' good , '' that would mean a babi to be taken care of , would mean the girl herself not a contributor to the famili support but a doubl burden . and if she went into prostitut , would her famili get the benefit ? no . the mother made littl effort to save their son ; they concentr on the daughter . it was piti to see how in their ignor they were unawar of the strongest forc work against them . the talk of all this motley human -- of '' good '' no less than `` bad '' women , of steadi workingmen , of polit heeler , thiev and bum and runner for dive -- was frank , often hideous , obscen . the jam togeth way of live made modesti imposs , or scantest decenc -- made the pictur of it among the aspir few , usual for the benefit of religion or charit visitor , a piti , grotesqu hypocrisi . inde , the prostitut class was the highest in this respect . the streetwalk , those who prosper , had better master , learn someth about the pleasur and charm of privaci , also had more leisur in which to think , in howev crude a way , about the refin of life , and more money with which to practic those refin . the boy from the earliest age were on term of licenti freedom with the girl . the favorit children 's game , often play in the open street with the elder look on and laugh , were sex game . the veri babi use foul languag -- that is , use the languag they learn both at home and in the street . it was primit man ; susan was at the foundat of the world . to speak of the condit there as a product of civil is to show ignor of the histori of our race , is to fanci that we are civil today , when in fact we are -- histor -- in a turbul and pain period of transit from a better yesterday toward a tomorrow in which life will be worth live as it never has been befor in all the age of durat . in this today of movement toward civil which began with the discoveri of iron and will end when we shall have discov how to use for the benefit of all the main forc of natur -- in this today of agit incid to journey , we are in some respect better off , in other respect wors off , than the race was ten or fifteen thousand year ago . we have lost much of the freedom that was our befor the rise of govern and rule class ; we have gain much -- not so much as the ignor and the unthink and the uneduc imagin , but still much . in the end we which mean the mass of us -- will gain infinit . but gain or loss has not been in so-cal moral . there is not a virtu that has not exist from time age befor record . not a vice which is shallowli call `` effet '' or the `` product of over-civil , '' but origin befor man was man . to speak of the condit in which susan lenox now live as savageri is to misus the word . everi transit stage is accompani by a disintegr . savageri was a settl state in which everi man and everi woman had his or her fix posit , settl duti and right . with the downfal of savageri with the begin of the journey toward that hope of tomorrow , civil , everyth in the relat of men with men and men with women , becam unsettl . such social system as the world has known sinc have all been makeshift and temporari -- like our social system of today , like the moral and extinct code rise and sink in power over a vast multitud of emigr move from a distant abandon home toward a distant promis land and forc to live as best they can in the interv . in the histor day 's journey of perhap fifteen thousand year our present time is but a brief second . in that second there has come a break up of the makeshift organ which long serv the work multitud fair well . the result is an anarchi in which the strong oppress the weak , in which the mass are be crush by the burden impos upon them by the class . and in that particular part of the human race en rout into which fate had flung susan lenox condit not of savageri but of primit chao were prevail . a larg part of the popul live off the unhappi worker by prostitut , by thiev , by petti swindl , by polit , by the various devic in coars , crude and small imit of the devic employ by the rule class . and these petti parasit imit the big parasit in their way of spend their dubious got gain . to have a `` good time '' was the ideal here as in idl fifth avenu ; and the notion of a `` good time '' in vogu in the two opposit quarter differ in degre rather than in kind . noth to think about but the appetit and their vice . noth to hope for but the next carous . susan had brought down with her from abov one desir unknown to her associ and neighbor -- the desir to forget . if she could onli forget ! if the poison would not wear off at time ! she could not quit forget . and to be unabl to forget is to rememb -- and to rememb is to long -- and to long is to hope . sever time she heard of freddi palmer . twice she chanc upon his name in the newspap -- an incident refer to him in connect with local polit . the other time were when men talk togeth in the drink place frequent by both sex spoke of him as a minor power in the organ . each time she got a sens of her remot , of her secur . onc she pass in grand street a detect she had often seen with him in considin 's at broadway and forty-second . the `` bull '' look sharpli at her . her heart stood still . but he went on without recogn her . the sharp glanc had been simpli that offici express of see-al and know-al which is mere formal , part of the offici liveri , otherwis meaningless . howev , it is not to that detect 's discredit that he fail to recogn her . she had adapt herself to her chang surround . becaus she was of a differ and higher class , and becaus she pick and chose her compani , even when drink had becloud her sens and instinct alon remain on drowsi guard , she prosper despit her indiffer . for that region had it aristocraci of rich merchant , tenement-own , politician whose son , close imit of the uptown aristocraci in manner and dress , spent money freeli in the amus that attract near all young men everywher . susan made almost as much as she could have made in the more renown quarter of the town . and present she was abl to move into a tenement which , except for two workingmen 's famili of a better class , was given over entir to fast women . it was much better kept , much cleaner , much better furnish than the tenement for worker chiefli ; they could not afford decenc , much less luxuri . all that sort of thing was , for the neighborhood , concentr in the saloon , the danc hall , the fast hous and the fast flat . her walk in grand street and the boweri , repel and caprici though she was with her altern mood of cold moros and sardon and mock gayeti , were bring her in a good sum of money for that region . sometim as much as twenti dollar a week , rare less than twelv or fifteen . and despit her drink and her freehanded with her fellow-profession less fortun and with the street beggar and for tenement chariti , she had in her stock a capit of thirty-on dollar . she avoid the tough place , the hang-out of the gang . she rare went alon into the street at night -- and the afternoon were , luckili , best for busi as well as for safeti . she made no friend and therefor no enemi . without mean to do so and without realiz that she did so , she held herself aloof without haughti through sens of loneli , not at all through sens of superior . had it not been for her scarlet lip , a far more mark sign in that region than anywher uptown , she would have pass in the street for a more or less respect woman -- not thorough respect ; she was too well dress , too intellig care for to seem the good work girl . on one of the few night when she linger in the littl back room of the saloon a few door away at the corner , as she enter the dark passageway of the tenement , strong finger close upon her throat and she was born to the floor . she knew at onc that she was in the clutch of one of those terror of tenement fast women , the lobbygow -- men who live by lie in wait in the dark to seiz and rob the lone , friendless fast woman . she struggl -- and she was anyth but weak . but not a sound could escap from her tight-press throat . soon she becam unconsci . one of the workingmen , return drunk from the meet of the union , in the corner saloon , stumbl over her , gave her a kick in his anger . this rous her ; she utter a faint cri . `` thought it was a man , '' mumbl he , drag her to a sit posit . he struck a match . `` oh -- it 's you ! do n't make ani nois . if my old woman came out , she 'd kill us both . '' `` never mind me , '' said susan . `` i was onli stun . '' `` oh , i thought it was the booz . they say you hit it someth fierc . '' `` no -- a lobbygow . '' and she felt for her stock . they were torn away from her garter . her bosom also was bare , for the lobbygow had search there , also . `` how much did he get ? '' `` about thirty-f . '' `` the hell he did ! want me to call a cop ? '' `` no , '' repli susan , who was on her feet again . `` what 's the use ? '' `` those damn cop ! '' curs the workingman . `` they 'd probabl pinch you -- or both of us . ten to one the lobbygow divid with them . '' `` i did n't mean that , '' said susan . the polic were most friend and most kind to her . she was understand the way of the world better now , and appreci that the polic themselv were part of the same vast system of tyranni and robberi that was compel her . the polic made her pay becaus they dare not refus to be collector . they bound whom the mysteri invis power compel them to bind ; they loos whom that same power bade them loos . she had no quarrel with the polic , who protect her from far wors oppress and oppressor than that to which they subject her . and if they toler lobbygow and divid with them , it was becaus the overshadow power ordain it so . `` need n't be afraid i ll blow to the cop , '' said the drunken artisan . `` you can damn the cop all you pleas to me . they make new york wors than russia . '' `` i guess they do the best they can -- like everybodi els , '' said the girl wearili . `` i ll help you upstair . '' `` no , thank you , '' said she . not that she did not need help ; but she wish no disagre scene with the workingman 's wife who might open the door as they pass his famili 's flat . she went upstair , the man wait below until she should be safe -- and out of the way . she stagger into her room , totter to the bed , fell upon it . a girl name clara , who live across the hall , was sit in a rocking-chair in a nightgown , read a bertha clay novel and smoke a cigarett . she glanc up , was arrest by the strang look in susan 's eye . `` hello -- been hit the pipe , i see , '' said she . `` down in gussi 's room ? '' `` no . a lobbygow , '' said susan . `` did he get much ? '' `` about thirty-f . '' `` the -- -- ! '' cri clara . `` i ll bet it was gussi 's fellow . i ve suspect him . him and her stay in , hit the pipe all the time . that cost money , and she has n't been out for i do n't know how long . let 's go down there and rais hell . '' `` what 's the use ? '' said susan . `` you ought to ' a ' put it in the save bank . that 's what i do -- when i have anyth . then , when i 'm rob , they onli get what i ve just made . last time , they did n't get noth -- but me . '' and she laugh . her teeth were good in front , but out on one side and begin to be discolor on the other . `` how long had you been save ? '' `` near six month . '' `` gee ! _isn't_ that hell ! '' present she laugh . `` six month work and onli thirty-f to show for it . guess you re about as poor at hive it up as i am . i give it to that loafer i live with . you give it away to anybodi that want a stake . well -- what 's the diff ? it all goe . '' `` give me a cigarett , '' said susan , sit up and inspect the bruis on her bosom and leg . `` and get that bottl of whiskey from under the soil cloth in the bottom of the washstand . '' `` it _is_ someth to celebr , is n't it ? '' said clara . `` my fellow 's gone to his club tonight , so i did n't go out . i never do ani more , unless he 's there to hang round and see that i ai n't done up . you ll have to get a fellow . you ll have to come to it , as i 'm alway tell you . they re expens , but they re compani -- anybodi you can count on for shine up , even if it is for what they can get out of you , is better than not have nobodi nowher . and they keep off bum and lobbygow and scare the bilker into cough up . '' `` not for me , '' repli susan . the greater the catastroph , the longer the time befor it is fulli realiz . susan 's loss of the money that repres so much of savag if momentari horror , and so much of unconsci hope this calam did not overwhelm her for sever day . then she yield for the first time to the lure of opium . she had listen long to the descript of the delight as girl and men told ; for practic all of them smoke -- or took cocain . but to clara 's or gussi 's invit to join the happi band of dreamer , she had alway repli , `` not yet . i'm save that . '' now , howev , she felt that the time had come . hope in this world she had none . befor the black adventur , whi not tri the world of bliss unreal to which it gave entranc ? whi leav life until she had exhaust all it put within her reach ? she went to gussi 's room at midnight and flung herself down in a wrapper upon a couch opposit a sallow , delic young man . his great dark eye were gaze unse at her , were perhap use her as an outlin sketch from which his imagin could pictur a beauti of loveli beyond human . gussi taught her how to prepar the littl ball of opium , how to put it on the pipe and draw in it fume . her system was so well prepar for it by the poison she had drunk that she had satisfactori result from the outset . and she enter upon the happiest period of her life thus far . all the hideous of her profess disappear under the gorgeous draperi of the imagin . opium 's magic transform the vile , the obscen , into the lofti , the romant , the exalt . the world she had been accustom to regard as real ceas to be even the blur the poison liquor had made of it , becam a vagu , distant thing seen in a dream . her opium world becam the vivid realiti . the life she had been lead had made her extrem thin , had harden and dull her eye , had given her that sad , shudder express of the face upon which have beaten a thousand mercenari and lust kiss . the opium soon chang all this . her skin , alway tend toward pallor , becam of the dead amber-whit of old ivori . her thin took on an ether transpar that gave charm even to her slight stoop . her face becam dreami , exalt , rapt ; and her violet-gray eye look from it like the vent of poetic fire burn without ceas upon an altar to the god of dream . never had she been so beauti ; never had she been so happi -- not with the coarser happi of danc eye and laugh lip , but with the ecstasi of soul that is like the shimmer of a tranquil sea quiver rhythmic under the caress of moonlight . in her descent she had now reach that long narrow shelf along which she would walk so long as health and look should last -- unless some accid should toppl her off on the one side into suicid or on the other side into the crimin prostitut class . and such accid were like to happen . still there was a fair chanc of her keep her balanc until loss of look and loss of health -- the end of the shelf -- should drop her abrupt to the veri bottom . she could guess what was there . everi day she saw about the street , most wretch and most forlorn of it wretch and forlorn thing , the solitari old women , bent and twist , wrap in rot rag , pick paper and tobacco from the gutter and burrow in garbag barrel , seek somehow to get the drink or the dope that chang hell into heaven for them . despit liquor and opium and the degrad of the street-woman 's life she walk that narrow ledg with curious steadi . she was unconsci of the caus . inde , self-consci had never been one of her trait . the caus is interest . in our egot , in our shame of what we ignor regard as the lowli of our origin we are alway seek alleg lofti spiritu explan of our do , and overlook the actual , quit simpl real reason . one of the strongest factor in susan 's hold herself togeth in face of overwhelm odd , was the near seventeen year of earli train her aunt fanni warham had given her in order and systemat way -- a place for everyth and everyth in it place ; a time for everyth and everyth at it time , neat , scrupul cleanli , no neglect of ani of the small , yet larg , matter that conserv the bodi . susan had not been so apt a pupil of fanni warham 's as was ruth , becaus susan had not ruth 's natur of the old-maidish , cut-and-dri convent . but dure the whole fundament format period of her life susan lenox had been train to order and system , and they had becom part of her be , beyond the power of drink and opium and prostitut to disintegr them until the general break-up should come . in all her wander everi man or woman or girl she had met who was not rapid break up , but was offer more or less resist to the assault of bad habit , was one who like herself had acquir in childhood strong good habit to oppos the bad habit and to fight them with . an enemi must be met with his own weapon or stronger . the strongest weapon that can be given a human anim for combat the destruct forc of the struggl for exist are not good sentiment or good principl or even pious or moral practic -- for , bad habit can make short work of all these -- but are good habit in the practic , materi matter of life . they oper automat , they appli to all the multitud of small , everi day ; semi-unconsci action of the daili routin . they preserv the _morale_ . and not moral but moral is the warp of charact -- the part which , onc destroy or even fray , can not be restor . susan , unconsci and tenaci practic her earli train in order and system whenev she could and wherev she could , had an enorm advantag over the mass of the girl , both respect and fast . and while their evid was alway toward `` go to piec '' her tendenc was alway to repair and to put off the break-up . one june even she was look through the better class of danc hall and drink resort for clara , to get her to go up to gussi 's for a smoke . she open a door she had never happen to enter befor -- a dingi door with the glass frost . just insid there was a fetid littl bar ; view of the rest of the room was cut off by a screen from behind which came the sound of a tuneless old piano . she knew clara would not be in such a den , but out of curios she glanc round the screen . she was see a low-ceiling room , the wall almost drip with the dirt of mani and mani a hard year . in a corner was the piano , batter , about to fall to piec , it ancient and horrid voic crack by the liquor which had been pour into it by faceti drunkard . at the keyboard sat an old hunchback , broken-jaw , dress in slimi rag , his one eye instant fix upon her with a lecher express that made her shiver as it compel her to imagin the embrac he was evid imagin . his filthi finger were pound out a waltz . about the floor were totter in the measur of the waltz a score of dread old women . they were in calico . they had each a littl biscuit knot of white hair firm upon the crown of the head . from their bleach , seam old face gleam the long or the torment of all the passion they could no longer either inspir or satisfi . they were one time prostitut , one time young , perhap pretti women , now descend to death -- still prostitut in heart and mind but compel to live as scrub women , cleaner of all manner of loathsom mess in dive after the drunkard had pass on . they were now enjoy the reward of their toil , the pleasur of which they dream and to which they look forward as they drag their stiff old knee along the floor in the wake of the brush and the cloth . they were drink bite poison from tin cup -- for those hand quiver with palsi could not be trust with glass-danc with drunken , disease-swollen or twist leg -- vent from ghast toothless mouth strang cri of merriment that sound like shriek of damn soul at the lick of quenchless flame . susan stood root to the threshold of that fright scene -- that vision of the futur toward which she was hurri . a few year -- a veri few year -- and , unless she should have pass through the morgu , here she would be , abandon her bodi to abomin beyond belief at the hand of degener orient sailor to get a few penni for the privileg of this danc hall . and she would laugh , as did these , would enjoy as did these , would revel in the filth her sens had been train to find sweet . `` no ! no ! '' she protest . `` i'd kill myself first ! '' and then she cower again , as the thought came that she probabl would not , ani more than these had kill themselv . the descent would be gradual -- no matter how swift , still gradual . onli the insan put an end to life . yes -- she would come here some day . she lean against the wall , her throat contract in a fit of nausea . she grew cold all over ; her teeth chatter . she tri in vain to tear her gaze from the spectacl ; some invis power seem to be hold her head in a vise , thrust her struggl eyelid violent open . there were sever men , dead drunk , asleep in old wooden chair against the wall . one of these men was so near her that she could have touch him . his cloth was such an assort of rag slimi and greasi as one sometim see upon the top of a fill garbag barrel to add it horror of odor of long unwash human to the stench from veget decay . his wreck of a hard hat had fallen from his head as it drop forward in drunken sleep . someth in the shape of the head made her concentr upon this man . she gave a sharp cri , stretch out her hand , touch the man 's shoulder . `` rod ! '' she cri . `` rod ! '' the head slowli lift , and the bleari , blowsi wreck of roderick spenser 's handsom face was turn stupid toward her . into his gray eye slowli came a gleam of recognit . then she saw the red of shame burst into his hollow cheek , and the head quick droop . she shook him . `` rod ! it 's _you ! _ '' '' get the hell out , '' he mumbl . `` i want to sleep . '' `` you know me , '' she said . `` i see the color in your face . oh , rod -- you need n't be asham befor _me_ . '' she felt him quiver under her finger press upon his shoulder . but he pretend to snore . `` rod , '' she plead , `` i want you to come along with me . i can't do you ani harm now .

'' she said to them . `` sure ! '' repli they in chorus . and , with no outward sign of the disgust they must have felt at the contact , they lift up the sot , in such fantast contrast to susan 's clean and even stylish appear , and bore him along , tri to make him seem less the helpless whiskey-soak dead weight . they drag him up the two flight of stair and , as she push back the door , deposit him on the floor . she assur them they could do noth more , thank them , and they depart . clara appear in her doorway . `` god almighti , lorna !

'' terri 's brother had got drunk a few day befor , had kill a woman and was on his way to the chair . terri scowl at the boss and said : '' she 's got a right to , ai n't she ? do n't she earn her money honest , without harmin ' anybodi but herself ? there ai n't mani that can say that -- not ani that run factori and store and hold their nose up as if they smelt their own sin , damn em ! '' `` she 's a nice girl , '' said rafferti , saunter away . he was a broad , toler and good-humor man ; he made allow for an employe whose brother was in for murder . susan had littl time to spend at the hospit . she must now earn fifti dollar a week -- near doubl the amount she had been averag . she must pay the twenty-f dollar for spenser , the ten dollar for her lodg . then there was the seven dollar which must be hand to the polic captain '' wardman '' in the dark of some entri everi thursday night . she had been pay the patrolman three dollar a week to keep him in a good humor , and two dollar to the janitor 's wife ; she might risk cut out these item for the time , as both janitor 's wife and policeman were sympathet . but on the closest figur , fifti a week would bare meet her absolut necess -- would give her but seven a week for food and other expens and noth toward repay clara . fifti dollar a week ! she might have a better chanc to make it could she go back to the broadway-fifth avenu district . but howev vagu other impress from the life about her might have been , there had been brand into her a deep and terribl fear of the polic an omnipot as cruel as destini itself -- inde , the visibl form of that sinist god at present . onc in the pariah class , onc with a `` polic record , '' and a man or woman would have to scale the steep of respect up to a far loftier height than susan ever dream of again reach , befor that malign and relentless power would abandon it tyranni . she did not dare risk adventur a part of town where she had no `` pull '' and where , even should she by chanc escap arrest , freddi palmer would hear of her ; would certain reveng himself by have her arrest and made an exampl of . in the grand street district she must stay , and she must `` stop the nonsens '' and `` play the game '' -- must be business-lik . she went to see the `` wardman , '' o'ryan , who under the guis of be a plain cloth man or detect , collect and turn in to the captain , who took his `` bit '' and pass up the rest , all the money levi upon saloon , dive , procuress , dealer in unlaw good of ani kind from opium and cocain to girl for '' hock shop . '' o'ryan was a huge brute of a man , his great hard face bear the scar of battl against pistol , knife , bludgeon and fist . he was a sour and savag brute , hate and fear by everyon for his tyranni over the helpless poor and the helpless outcast class . he had primit masculin notion as to feminin virtu , intact despit the latter day general disposit to conced toler and even a certain respect to prostitut . but by some chanc which she and the other girl did not understand he treat susan with the utmost consider , made the gang appreci that if they annoy her or tri to drag her into the net of tribut in which they had enmesh most of the girl worth while , he would regard it as a person defianc to himself . susan wait in the back room of the saloon nearest o'ryan lodg and sent a boy to ask him to come . the boy came back with the astonish messag that she was to come to o'ryan flat . susan was so doubt that she paus to ask the janitress about it . `` it 's all right , '' said the janitress . `` sinc his wife die three year ago him and his babi live alon . there 's his old mother but she 's gone out . he 's alway at home when he ain't on duti . he take care of the babi himself , though it howl all the time someth aw . '' susan ascend , found the big policeman in his shirt sleev , tri to sooth the most hideous monstros she had ever seen -- a misshapen , hairi anim look like a monkey , like a rat , like half a dozen repuls anim , and not at all like a human be . the thing was claw and growl and grind it teeth . at sight of susan it fix malevol eye on her and began to snap it teeth at her . `` do n't mind him , '' said o'ryan . `` he 's onli act up queer . '' susan sat not dare to look at the thing lest she should show her avers , and not know how to state her busi when the thing was so clamor , so fiendish uproari . after a time o'ryan succeed in quiet it . he seem to think some explan was necessari . he began abrupt , his gaze tender on the aw creatur , his child , lie quiet now in his arm : '' my wife -- she die some time ago -- die when the babi here was born . '' `` you spend a good deal of time with it , '' said susan . `` all i can spare from my job . i 'm afraid to trust him to anybodi , he be kind of differ . then , too , i _like_ to take care of him . you see , it 's all i ve got to rememb _her_ by . i 'm kind o ' tryin ' to do what _she'd_ want did . '' his lip quiver . he look at his monstrous child . `` yes , i _like_ settin ' here , thinkin ' -- and takin ' care of him . '' this brute of a slave driver , this cruel tyrant over the poor and the helpless -- yet , thus tender and gentl -- thus capabl of the enorm sacrific of a great , pure love ! `` _you've_ got a way of lookin ' out of the eye that 's like her , '' he went on -- and susan had the secret of his strang forbear toward her . `` i suppos you ve come about be let off on the assess ? '' alreadi he knew the whole stori of rod and the hospit . `` yes -- that 's whi i 'm bother you , '' said she . `` you need n't pay but five-fifti . i can onli let you off a dollar and a half -- my bit and the captain 's . we pass the rest on up -- and we do n't dare let you off . '' `` oh , i can make the money , '' susan said hastili . `` thank you , mr. o'ryan , but i do n't want to get anyon into troubl . '' `` we ve got the right to knock off one dollar and a half , '' said o'ryan . `` but if we let you off the other , the word would get up to -- to wherev the graft goe -- and they 'd send down along the line , to have merri hell rais with us . the whole thing done systemat , and they wo n't take no excus , wo n't allow no break in the system nowher . you can see for yourself -- it 'd go to smash if they did . '' `` somebodi must get a lot of money , '' said susan . `` oh , it 's dribbl out -- and as you go higher up , i don't suppos them that get it know where it come from . the whole world 's noth but graft , anyhow . sorri i ca n't let you off . '' the thing in his lap had recov strength for a fresh fit of malevol . it was tear at it hairi , hideous face with it claw and was howl and shriek , the big father gentl tri to sooth it -- for _her_ sake . susan got away quick . she halt in the desert hall and gave way to a spasm of dri sob -- an overflow of all the emot that had been accumul within her . in this world of noxious and repuls weed , what sudden startl upshoot of what beauti flower ! flower where you would expect to find the most noisom weed of all , and vilest weed where you would expect to find flower . what a world ! howev -- the fifti a week must be got -- and she must be business-lik . most of the girl who took to the street came direct from the tenement of new york , of the foreign citi or of the factori town of new england . and the world over , tenement hous life is an excel school for the life of the street . it prevent modesti from develop ; it familiar the eye , the ear , the nerv , to all that is brutal ; it take away from a girl everi feel that might act as a restrain influenc except fear -- fear of matern , of diseas , of prison . thus , practic all the other girl had the advantag over susan . soon after they definit abandon respect and appear in the street frank member of the profess , they becam bold and rapaci . they had an instinct feel that their busi was as reput as ani other , more reput than mani held in high reput , that it would be most reput if it paid better and were less uncertain . they respect themselv for all thing , talk to the contrari in the search for the sympathi and piti most human be crave . they despis the men as utter as the men despis them . they bargain as shameless as the men . even those who did not steal still felt that steal was justifi ; for , in the street the sex impuls show strip of all disguis , show as a brutal male appetit , and the femal feel that her yield to it entitl her to all she can compel and cozen and crib . susan had been unfit for her profess -- as for all activ , unshelt life -- by her earli train . the point of view given us in our childhood remain our point of view as to all the essenti of life to the end . reason , experi , the influenc of contact with mani phase of the world , may chang us seem , but the under-instinct remain unchang . thus , susan had never lost , and never would lose her origin repugn ; not even drink had ever given her the courag to approach men or to bargain with them . her shame was a fals shame , like most of the shame in the world -- a lack of courag , not a lack of desir -- and , howev we may pretend , there can be no virtu in abstin mere through cowardic . still , if there be merit in shrink , even when the cruelest necess were goad , that merit was her in full measur . as a matter of reason and sens , she admit that the girl who respect themselv and practic their profess like merchant of other kind were right , were do what she ought to do . anyhow , it was absurd to practic a profess half-heart . to play your game , whatev it might be , for all there was in it -- that was the obvious first principl of success . yet -- she remain laggard and squeamish . what she had been unabl to do for herself , to save herself from squalor , from hunger , from cold , she was now abl to do for the sake of anoth -- to help the man who had enabl her to escap from that marriag , more hideous than anyth she had endur sinc , or ever could be call upon to endur -- to save him from certain neglect and probabl death in the `` chariti '' hospit . not by mere toler the not too imposs men who join her without sign from her , and not by mere accept what they gave , could fifti dollar a week be made . she must dress herself in franker avow of her profess , must look as expens as her limit stock of cloth , supplement by her own tast , would permit . she must flirt , must bargain , must ask for present , must make herself agreeabl , must resort to the crude femal art -- which , howev , are subtl enough to convinc the self-ench male even in face of the discourag fact of the mercenari arrang . she must crush down her repugn , must be activ , not simpli passiv -- must get the extra dollar by stimul male appetit , instead of simpli permit them to satisfi themselv . she must seem rather the eager mistress than the reluct and impati wife . and she did abrupt chang her manner . there was in her , as her life had shown , a power of endur , an abil to sacrific herself in order to do the thing that seem necessari , and to do it without shuffl or whine . whatev els her career had done for her , it undoubt had strengthen this part of her natur . and now the result of her train show . with her superior intellig for the first time free to make the best of her opportun , she abrupt becam equal to the most consumm of her sister in that long line of her sister-pand to male appetit which extend from the bought wife or mistress or fiance of the rich grande down all the social rank to the wife or street girl cozen for a tipsi day-labor 's earn on a saturday night and the work girl teas her `` steadi compani '' toward matrimoni on the park bench or in the dark entri of the tenement . she was abl to pay clara back in less than ten day . in spenser 's second week at the hospit she had him move to better quarter and better attend at thirti dollar a week . although she had never got rid of her most unprofession habit of choos and reject , there had been time when need forc her into strait where her lot seem to her almost as low as that of the slave-lik wive of the tenement , made her almost think she would be near as well off were she the wife , companion , butt , servant and general vent to some one dull and distast provid of a poor live . but now she no longer felt either degrad or heart sick and heart weari . and when he pass the worst crisi her spirit began to return . and when roderick should be well , and the sketch written -- and an engag got -- ah , then ! life inde -- life , at last ! was it this hope that gave her the strength to fight down and conquer the crave for opium ? or was it the necess of keep her wit and of save everi cent ? or was it becaus the opium habit , like the drink habit , like everi other habit , is a matter of a tempera far more than it is a matter of an appetit -- and that she had the appetit but not the tempera ? no doubt this had it part in the quick and complet victori . at ani rate , fight and conquer she did . the strongest interest alway win . she had an interest stronger than love of opium -- an interest that substitut itself for opium and for drink and supplant them . life inde -- life , at last ! in his third week rod began to round toward health . einstein observ from the nurs 's chart that susan 's visit were have an unfavor excit effect . he show her the read of temperatur and puls , and forbad her to stay longer than five minut at each of her two daili visit . also , she must not bring up ani topic beyond the sickroom itself . one day spenser greet her with , `` i ll feel better , now that i ve got this off my mind . '' he held out to her a letter . `` take that to georg fitzalan . he 's an old friend of mine -- one i ve done a lot for and never ask ani favor of . he may be abl to give you someth fair good , right away . '' susan glanc penetr at him , saw he had been brood over the sourc of the money that was be spent upon him . `` veri well , '' said she , `` i ll go as soon as i can . '' `` go this afternoon , '' said he with an invalid 's fret . `` and when you come this even you can tell me how you got on . '' `` veri well . this afternoon . but you know , rod , there 's not a ghost of a chanc . '' `` i tell you fitzalan 's my friend . he 's got some gratitud . he ll _do_ someth . '' `` i do n't want you to get into a mood where you ll be aw depress if i should fail . '' `` but you ll not fail . '' it was evid that spenser , untaught by experi and flatter into exagger his import by the solicitud and defer of doctor and nurs to a pay invalid , had restor to favor his ancient enemi -- optim , the certain destroy of ani man who doe not shake it off . she went away , depress and worri . when she should come back with the onli possibl news , what would be the effect upon him -- and he still in a critic stage ? as the afternoon must be given to busi , she decid to go straight uptown , hope to catch fitzalan befor he went out to lunch . and twenti minut after make this decis she was sit in the anteroom of a suit of theatric offic in the empir theater build . the girl in attend had , as usual , all the air littl peopl assum when they are in close , if menial , relat with a person who , be import to them , therefor fill their whole small horizon . she deign to take in susan 's name and the letter . susan seat herself at the long tabl and with the seem of calm that alway veil her in her hour of greatest agit , turn over the page of the theatric journal and magazin spread about in quantiti . after perhap ten silent and uninterrupt minut a man hurri in from the outsid hall , strode toward the frost glass door mark `` privat . '' with his hand reach for the knob he halt , made an impati gestur , plump himself down at the long tabl -- at it distant opposit end . with a sweep of the arm he clear a space wherein he proceed to spread paper from his pocket and to scribbl upon them furious . when susan happen to glanc at him , his head was bent so low and his straw hat was tilt so far forward that she could not see his face . she observ that he was dress attract in an extrem light summer suit of homespun ; his hand were larg and strong and ruddi -- the hand of an artist , in good health . her glanc return to the magazin . after a few minut she look up . she was startl to find that the man was give her a curious , search inspect -- and that he was brent , the playwright -- the same fascin face , keen , cynic , amus -- the same see eye , that , in the cafe martin long ago , had made her feel as if she were be read to her most secret thought . she drop her glanc . his voic made her start . `` it 's been a long time sinc i'v seen you , '' he was say . she look up , not believ it possibl he was address her . but his gaze was upon her . thus , she had not been mistaken in think she had seen recognit in his eye . `` yes , '' she said , with a faint smile . `` a longer time for you than for me , '' said he . `` a good deal has happen to me , '' she admit . `` are you on the stage ? '' `` no . not yet . '' the girl enter by way of the privat door . `` miss lenox -- this way , pleas . '' she saw brent , becam instant all smile and bow . `` oh -- mr. fitzalan doe n't know you re here , mr. brent , '' she cri . then , to susan , `` wait a minut . '' she was about to reenter the privat offic when brent stop her with , `` let miss lenox go in first . i do n't wish to see mr. fitzalan yet . '' and he stood up , took off his hat , bow grave to susan , said , `` i 'm glad to have seen you again . '' susan , with some color forc into her old-ivori skin by nervous and amaz , went into the presenc of fitzalan . as the now obsequi girl close the door behind her , she found herself face a youngish man with a remnant of hair that was littl more than fuzz on the top of his head . his featur were sharp , aggress , rather hard . he might have sat for the typic success american young man of forti -- so much younger in new york than is forti elsewher in the unit state -- and so much older . he look at susan with a pleasant sympathet smile . `` so , '' said he , `` you re take care of poor spenser , are you ? tell him i ll tri to run down to see him . i wish i could do someth for him -- someth worth while , i mean . but -- his request -- -- '' realli , i ve noth of the kind . i could n't possibl place you -- at least , not at present -- perhap , later on -- -- '' '' i understand , '' interrupt susan . `` he 's veri ill . it would help him great if you would write him a few line , say you ll give me a place at the first vacanc , but that it may not be soon . i ll not troubl you again . i want the letter simpli to carri him over the crisi . '' fitzalan hesit , rub his fuzzi crown with his jewel hand . `` tell him that , '' he said , final . `` i 'm rather care about write letter . . . . yes , say to him what you suggest , as if it was from me . '' `` the letter will make all the differ between his believ and not believ , '' urg susan . `` he has great admir and like for you -- think you would do anyth for him . '' fitzalan frown ; she saw that her insist had rous -- or , rather , had strengthen -- suspicion . `` realli -- you must excus me . what i ve heard about him the past year has not -- -- '' but , no matter , i ca n't do it . you ll let me know how he get on ? good day . '' and he gave her that polit yet posit nod of dismiss which is a necessari part of the equip of men of affair , constant beset as they are and ever engag in the battl to save their chief asset , time , from be wast . susan look at him -- a straight glanc from gray eye , a slight smile hover about her scarlet lip . he redden , fuss with the paper befor him on the desk from which he had not risen . she open the door , close it behind her . brent was seat with his back full to her and was busi with his scribbl . she pass him , went on to the outer door . she was wait for his voic ; she knew it would come . `` miss lenox ! '' as she turn he was advanc . his figur , tall and slim and straight , had the eas of movement which proclaim the man who has been everywher and so is at home anywher . he held out a card . `` i wish to see you on busi . you can come at three this afternoon ? '' `` yes , '' said susan . `` thank , '' said he , bow and return to the tabl . she went on into the hall , the card between her finger . at the elev , she stood stare at the name -- robert brent -- as if it were an inscript in a forgotten languag . she was so absorb , so daze that she did not ring the bell . the car happen to stop at that floor ; she enter as if it were dark . and , in the street , she wander mani block down broadway befor she realiz where she was . she left the elev and walk eastward through grand street . she was fill with a new and profound dissatisfact . she felt like one awaken from a hypnot tranc . the surround , inanim and anim , that had becom endur through custom abrupt resum their origin aspect of squalor and ugli of repuls and tragedi . a stranger -- the ordinari , unobserv , feebli imagin person , go along those street would have seen noth but tawdri and poverti . susan , experienc , imagin , saw _all_ -- saw what anoth would have seen onli after it was point out , and even then but dim . and that day her vision was no longer stale and deaden by familiar , but with vision fresh and with nerv acut . the men -- the women -- and , saddest , most tragic of all , the children ! when she enter her room her reawaken sensit , the keener for it long repos , for the enorm unconsci absorpt of impress of the life about her -- this morbid sensit of the soul a-clash with it environ reach it climax . as she threw open the door , she shrank back befor the odor -- the power , sensual , sweet odor of chypr so effect in cover the bad smell that came up from other flat and from the noisom back yard . the room itself was neat and clean and plain , with not a few evid of her person tast -- in the blend of color , in the select of frame photograph on the wall . the one she especi like was the largest -- a nude woman lie at full length , her head support by her arm , her face gaze straight out of the pictur , upon it a baffl express -- of sad , of cynic , of amus perhap , of experi , yet of innoc . it hung upon the wall opposit the door . when she saw this pictur in the depart store , she felt at onc a sympathi between that woman and herself , felt she was for the first time see anoth soul like her own , one that would have understood her strang sens of innoc in the midst of her own defil and deprav self -- a core of unsulli natur . everyon els in the world would have mock at this notion of a someth within -- a true self to which all that seem to be her own self was as extern as her cloth ; this woman of the photograph would understand . so , there she hung -- susan 's one prize possess . the question of dress for this interview with brent was most import . susan gave it much thought befor she began to dress , chang her mind again and again in the cours of dress . through all her vicissitud she had never lost her interest in the art of dress or her skill at it -- and despit the unfavor surround she had steadili improv ; ani woman anywher would instant have recogn her as one of those few favor and envi women who know how to get togeth a toilet . she final chose the simplest of the half dozen summer dress she had made for herself -- a plain white lawn , with a short skirt . it gave her an appear of extrem youth , despit her height and the slight stoop in her shoulder -- a mere droop that harmon touch with the young yet weari express of her face . to go with the dress she had a larg hat of black rough straw with a veri littl white trim on it . with this larg black hat bewitch set upon her gracefully-don dark wavi hair , her sad , dreami eye , her pallid skin , her sweet-bitt mouth with it roug lip seem to her to show at their best . she felt that noth was quit so effect for her skin as a white dress . in other color -- though she did not realiz -- the woman of bought kiss show more distinct -- never brazen as in most of the girl , but still unmistak . in white she took on a glamour of melancholi -- and the human counten is capabl of no express so univers appeal as the look of melancholi that suggest the sad under all life , the pain that pay for pleasur , the pain that pay and get no pleasur , the sorrow of the pass of all thing , the faint foreshadow of the doom await us all . she wash the roug from her lip , studi the effect in the glass . `` no , '' she said aloud , '' without it i feel like a hypocrit -- and i do n't look half so well . '' and she put the roug on again -- the scarlet dash drawn startl across her strang , pallid face . chapter xii at three that afternoon she stood in the vestibul of brent small hous in park avenu overlook the oblong of green between east thirty-seventh street and east thirty-eighth . a most reput look englishman in even dress open the door ; from her read and her theater-go she knew that this was a butler . he bow her in . the entir lower floor was given to an entranc hall , done in plain black walnut , almost lofti of ceil , and with a grand stairway lead to the upper part of the hous . there was a huge fireplac to the right ; a mirror fill the entir back wall ; a broad low seat ran all round the room . in one corner , an enorm urn of dark potteri ; in anoth corner , a suit of armor , the helmet , the breastplat and the gauntlet set with gold of ancient lacklust . the butler left her there and ascend the polish but dead-finish stairway noiseless . susan had never befor been in so grand a room . the best privat hous she had ever seen was wright 's in sutherland ; and while everybodi els in sutherland thought it magnific , she had felt that there was someth wrong , what she had not known . the grandios new york hotel and restaur were more showi and more pretenti far than this interior of brent 's . but her uner instinct of those born with good tast knew at first view of them that they were simpli cost ; there were beauti thing in them , fine carv and paint and tapestri , but person was lack . and without person there can be no uniti ; without uniti there can be no harmoni -- and without harmoni , no beauti . look round her now , she had her first deep draught of esthet delight in interior decor . she love this quiet digniti , this larg simplic -- noth that obtrud , noth that jar , everyth on the same scale of dark color and larg size . she admir the way the mirror , without pretens of be anyth but a mirror , enhanc the spacious of the room and doubl the pleasur it gave by offer anoth and differ view of it . last of all susan caught sight of herself -- a slim , slight stoop figur , it white dress and it big black hat with white trim make it stand out strong against the rather somber background . in a curious imperson way her own sad , wist face interest her . a human be 's face is a summari of his career . no man can realiz at a thought what he is , can epitom in just proport what has been made of him by experi of the multitud of moment of which life is compos . but in some mood and in some light we do get such an all-comprehend view of ourselv in look at our own face . as she had instinct felt , there was a world of mean in the contrast between her pensiv brow abov melancholi eye and the blood-r line of her roug lip . the butler descend . `` mr. brent is in his librari , on the fourth floor , '' said he . `` will you kind step this way , ma'am ? '' instead of indic the stairway , he went to the panel next the chimney piec . she saw that it was a hidden door admit to an elev . she enter ; the door close ; the elev ascend rapid . when it came to a stop the door open and she was face brent . `` thank you for come , '' said he , with almost formal courtesi . for all her sudden shyness , she cast a quick but see look round . it was an overcast day ; the soft flood of liquid light -- the beauti light of her belov citi of the sun -- pour into the big room through an enorm window of clear glass which form the entir north wall . round the other wall from floor almost to lofti ceil were book in solid row ; not book with ornament bind , but book for use , book that had been and were be use . by way of furnitur there were an immens loung , wide and long and deep , face the left chimney piec , an immens tabl desk face the north light , three great chair with tall back , one behind the tabl , one near the end of the tabl , the third in the corner farthest from the window ; a grand piano , open , with music upon it rack , and a long carv seat at it keyboard . the huge window had a broad sill upon which was built a generous window garden fresh and live with bright flower . the woodwork , the ceil , the furnitur were of mahogani . the master of this splendid simplic was dress in a blue hous suit of some summer materi like linen . he was smoke a cigarett , and offer her one from the great carv wood box fill with them on the tabl desk . `` thank , '' said she . and when she had light it and was seat face him as he sat at his desk , she felt almost at her eas . after all , while his gaze was penetr , it was also understand ; we do not mind be unmask if the unmask at onc hail us as brother . brent 's eye seem to say to her , `` human ! -- like me . '' she smoke and let her gaze wander from her book to window garden , from window garden to piano . `` you play ? '' said he . `` a veri littl . enough for accompani to simpl song . '' `` you sing ? '' `` simpl song . i ve had but a few lesson from a small-town teacher . '' `` let me hear . '' she went to the piano , laid her cigarett in a tray readi besid the music rack . she gave him the `` gipsi queen , '' which she like becaus it express her own passion of revolt against restraint of everi convent kind and her love for the open air and open sky . he somehow took away all feel of embarrass ; she felt so strong that he understood and was big enough not to have it anywher in him to laugh at anyth sincer . when she finish she resum her cigarett and return to the chair near his . `` it 's as i thought , '' said he . `` your voic can be train -- to speak , i mean . i do n't know as to it sing valu . . . . have you good health ? '' `` i never have even cold . yes , i 'm strong . '' `` you ll need it . '' `` i have need it , '' said she . into her face came the sad , bitter express with it curious relief of a faint cynic smile . he lean back in his chair and look at her through a cloud of smoke . she saw that his eye were not gray , as she had thought , but brown , a hazel brown with point of light sparkl in the iris and take away all the suggest of weak and sentiment that make pure brown eye unsatisfactori in a man . he said slowli : '' when i saw you -- in the martin -- you were on the way down . you went , i see . '' she nod . `` i 'm still there . '' `` you like it ? you wish to stay ? '' she shook her head smile . `` no , but i can stay if it necessari . i ve discov that i ve got the health and the nerv for anyth .

'' she felt no shyness -- and no sens of necess of respond to a compliment , for his tone forbad ani thought of flatteri . she lower her gaze to conceal the thought his word brought -- the memori of the thing that had caus her eye to look as rod and now brent said . `` such an express , '' the playwright went on , `` must mean charact . i am sick and tire of the vaniti of these actress who can act just enough never to be abl to learn to act well . i 'm go to tri an experi with you . i'v tri it sever time but -- no matter . i 'm not discourag . i never give up . . . . can you stand be alon ?

is it an illus -- one more of the illus that have lure him on and on ? he doe not know ; but instant a fire sweep through him , warm his die strength into vigor . so it was with susan . the pariah class -- the real pariah class -- doe not consist of mere the women formal put beyond the pale for violat of convent moral and the men with the brand of thief or gambler upon them . our social , our industri system has made it far vaster . it includ almost the whole popul -- all those who sell bodi or brain or soul in an uncertain market for uncertain hire , to gain the day 's food and cloth , the night 's shelter . this vast mass float hither and yon on the tide and current of destini . now it halt , rest sluggish in a dead calm ; again it move , sometim slowli , sometim under the lash of tempest . but it is ever the same vast inertia , with no particl of it possess an aim beyond keep afloat and aliv . susan had been an atom , a spray of weed , in this sargasso sea . if you observ a huge , unwieldi crowd so close pack that noth can be done with it and it can do noth with itself , you will note three differ type . there are the entir inert -- and they make up most of the crowd . they do not resist ; they helpless move this way and that as the chanc wave of motion prompt . of this type is the overwhelm major of the human race . here and there in the mass you will see exampl of a second type . these are individu who are restiv and resent under the sens of helpless and impot . they struggl now gentl , now furious . they thrust backward or forward or to one side . they thresh about . but noth come of their effort beyond a brief agit , soon die away in rippl . the inertia of the mass and their own lack of purpos conquer them . occasion one of these grow so angri and so violent that the surround inertia quicken into purpos -- the purpos of make an end of this agit which is serv onli to increas the general discomfort . and the agit is trampl down , disappear , perhap silent , perhap with groan or shriek . continu to look at this crowd , so piti , so terribl , such a melancholi wast of incalcul power -- continu to observ and you may chanc upon an exampl of the third type . you are like at first to confus the third type with the second , for they seem to be much alik . here and there , of the resent struggler , will be one whose resent is intellig . he struggl , but it is not aimless struggl . he has seen or suspect in a definit direct a point where he would be more or less free , perhap entir free . he realiz how he is hem in , realiz how difficult , how danger , will be his endeavor to get to that point . and he proceed to tri to minim or overcom the difficulti , the danger . he struggl now gentl , now earnest , now violent -- but alway toward his fix object . he is driven back , to one side , is almost overwhelm . he caus commot that threaten to engulf him , and must paus or retreat until they have calm . you may have to watch him long befor you discov that , where other struggler have been aimless , he aim and resolv . and littl by littl he gain , make progress toward his goal -- and onc in a long while one such reach that goal . it is triumph , success . susan , young , inexperienc , daze ; now too despond , now too hope ; now too gentl and again too infuri -- susan had been altern between inertia and purposeless struggl . brent had given her the thing she lack -- had given her a definit , concret , tangibl purpos . he had shown her the place where , if she should arriv , she might be free of that hideous slaveri of the miser mass ; and he had inspir her with the hope that she could reach it . and that was the susan lenox who came back to the littl room in delancey street at half-past five . curious , while she was think much about brent , she was think even more about burlingham -- about their long talk on the show boat and in their wander in louisvill and cincinnati . his philosophi , his teach -- the wisdom he had , but was unabl to appli -- began to come back to her . it was not strang that she should rememb it , for she had admir him intens and had listen to his everi word , and she was then at the time when the memori take it clearest and strongest impress . the strang lay in the sudden with which burlingham , so long dead , sudden came to life , chang from a sad and tender memori to a vivid possibl , advis her , help her , urg her on . clara , dress to go to dinner with her lover , was wait to arrang about their meet to make togeth the usual round in the even . `` i ve got an hour befor i 'm due at the hospit , '' said susan . `` let 's go down to kelli 's for a drink .

'' he certain had made a sudden stride toward health . by way of do someth progress he had had a shave , and that had restor the look of youth to his face -- or , rather , had uncov it . a strong , handsom face it was -- much handsom than brent 's -- and with the subtl , moral weak of optimist vaniti well conceal . yes , much handsom than brent 's , which was n't realli handsom at all -- yet was superbl handsom , also -- the handsom that come from be through and through a somebodi . she saw again whi she had care for rod so deepli ; but she also saw whi she could not care again , at least not in that same absorb , self-effac way . physic attract -- yes . and a certain remnant of the feel of comradeship , too . but never again utter belief , worship admir -- or ani other degre of belief or admir beyond the mild and critic . she herself had grown . also , brent 's penetr and just analysi of spenser had put clear befor her precis what he was -- precis what she herself had been vagu think of him . as he talk on and on of sperri 's visit and the new project , she listen , look at his charact in the light brent had turn upon it -- brent who had in a few brief moment turn such flood of light upon so mani thing she had been see dim or not at all . moder prosper and moder advers bring out the best there is in a man ; the extrem of either bring out his worst . the actual man is the best there is in him , and not the worst , but it is one of the tragedi of life that those who have onc seen his worst ever afterward have sens of it chiefli , and can not return to the feel they had for him when his worst was undream of . `` i 'm not in love with brent , '' thought susan . `` but have known him , i ca n't ever ani more care for rod . he seem small besid brent -- and he _is_ small . '' spenser in his optimist dream aloud had reach a point where it was necessari to assign susan a role in his dazzl career . `` you ll not have to go on the stage , '' said he . `` i'll look out for you . by next week sperri and i will have got togeth a scenario for the play and when sperri read it to fitzalan we ll get an advanc of at least five hundr . so you and i will take a nice room and bath uptown -- as a starter -- and we ll be happi again -- happier than befor . '' `` no , i 'm go to support myself , '' said susan prompt . `` trash ! '' cri spenser , smile tender at her . `` do you suppos i 'd allow you to mix up in stage life ? you'v forgotten how jealous i am of you . you do n't know what i'v suffer sinc i ve been here sick , brood over what you'r do , to -- -- '' she laid her finger on his lip . `` what 's the use of fret about anyth that has to be ? '' said she , smile . `` i'm go to support myself . you may as well make up your mind to it . '' `` plenti of time to argu that out , '' said he , and his tone forecast his verdict on the argu . and he chang the subject by say , `` i see you still cling to your fad of look fascin about the feet . that was one of the reason i never could trust you . a girl with as charm feet and ankl as you have , and so much pride in get them up well , simpli can not be trustworthi . '' he laugh . `` no , you were made to be taken care of , my dear . '' she did not press the matter . she had taken her stand ; that was enough for the present . after an hour with him , she went home to get herself someth to eat on her gas stove . spenser 's confid in the futur did not move her even to the extent of lay out half a dollar on a restaur dinner . women have the habit of believ in the optimist outpour of egotist men , and often hasten men along the road to ruin by proclaim this belief and act upon it . but not intellig women of experi ; that sort of woman , by check optimist husband , father , son , lover , has even put off ruin -- sometim until death has had the chanc to save the optimist from the inevit consequ of his folli . when she finish her chop and veget , instead of light a cigarett and linger over a cup of black coffe she quick straighten up and began upon the play brent had given her . she had read it sever time the night befor , and again and again dure the day . but not until now did she feel suffici calm down from her agit of thought and emot to attack the play understand . thank to defect educ the most enlighten of us go through life much like a dim-sight man who has no spectacl . almost the whole of the wonder panorama of the univers is unseen by us , or , if seen , is but partial understood or absurd misunderstood . when it come to the subtler thing , the thing of scienc and art , rare inde is there anyon who has the necessari train to get more than the crudest , most imperfect pleasur from them . what littl train we have is so limp that it spoil the charm of mysteri with which savag ignor invest the univers from blade of grass to star , and doe not put in place of that broken charm the profound and loftier joy of understand . to take for illustr the most wide diffus of all the higher art and scienc , read : how mani so-cal '' educ '' peopl can read understand even a novel , the form of literatur design to make the least demand upon the mind ? peopl say they have read , but , when question , they show that they have got mere a glimmer of the real action , the faintest hint of style and character , have perhap note some stray epigram which they quot with evid faulti grasp of it mean . when the thing read is a play , almost no one can get from it a coher notion of what it is about . most of us have noth that can just be call imagin ; our earli train at home and at school kill in the shoot that finest plant of the mind 's garden . so there is no abil to fill in the pictur which the dramat author draw in outlin . susan had not seen `` cavalleria rusticana '' either as play or as opera . but when she and spenser were togeth in forty-fourth street , she had read play and had dream over them ; the talk had been almost altogeth of play -- of write play , of construct scene , of product , of act , of all the mani aspect of the theater . spenser read scene to her , got her to help him with critic , and she was present when he went over his work with drumley , rigg , townsend and the other . thus , read a play was no untri art to her . she read `` cavalleria '' through slowli , take about an hour to it . she saw now whi brent had given it to her as the primer lesson -- the simpl , element stori of a peasant girl 's ruin under promis of marriag ; of her lover 's weari of one who had onli crude physic charm ; of his be attract by a young marri woman , gay as well as pretti , offer the secur in intrigu that an unmarri woman could not offer . such a play is at onc the easiest and the hardest to act -- the easiest becaus everi audienc understand it perfect and suppli unconsci almost ani defect in the act ; the hardest becaus ani actor with the educ necessari to act well find it next to imposs to divest himself or herself of the sophist of educ and get back to the element anim . _santuzza_ or _lola_ ? susan debat . _santuzza_ was the big and easi part ; _lola_ , the smaller part , was of the kind that is usual neglect . but susan saw possibl in the charact of the woman who won _turiddu_ away -- the triumphant woman . the two women repres the two kind of love -- the love that is serious , the love that is light . and experi had taught her whi it is that human natur soon tire of intens , turn to frivol . she felt that , if she could act , she would tri to show that not _turiddu's_ fickl nor his contempt of the woman who had yield , but _santuzza's_ sad intens and _lola's_ butterfli gayeti had cost _santuzza_ her lover and her lover his life . so , it was not _santuzza's_ but _lola's_ first entranc that she studi . in the next morn 's mail , under cover address `` miss susan lenox , care of miss lorna sackvill , '' as she had written it for brent , came the promis check for forti dollar . it was sign john p. garvey , secretari , and was inclos with a note bear the same signatur : dear madam : herewith i send you a check for forti dollar for the first week 's salari under your arrang with mr. brent . no receipt is necessari . until further notic a check for the same amount will be mail you each thursday . unless you receiv notic to the contrari , pleas call as befor , at three o'clock next wednesday . it made her nervous to think of those five day befor she should see brent . he had assur her he would expect noth from her ; but she felt she must be abl to show him that she had not been wast her time -- his time , the time for which he was pay near six dollar a day . she must work everi wake hour , except the two hour each day at the hospit . she recal what brent had said about the advantag of be content alon -- and how everyth worth do must be done in solitud . she had never thought about her own feel as to compani and solitud , as it was not her habit to think about herself . but now she realiz how solitari she had been , and how it had bred in her habit of think and read -- and how valuabl these habit would be to her in her work . there was rod , for exampl . he hate be alon , must have someon around even when he was write ; and he had no tast for order or system . she understood whi it was so hard for him to stick at anyth , to put anyth through to the finish . with her fond for be alon , with her passion for read and think about what she read , sure she ought soon to begin to accomplish someth -- if there was ani abil in her . she found rod in higher spirit . sever idea for his play had come to him ; he alreadi saw it act , success , draw crowd hous , bring him in anywher from five hundr to a thousand a week . she was not troubl hunt for thing to talk about with him -- she , who could think of but one thing and that a secret from him . he talk his play , a steadi stream with not a see glanc at her or a question about her . she watch the littl clock at the side of the bed . at the end of an hour to the minut , she interrupt him in the middl of a sentenc . `` i must go now , '' said she , rise . `` sit down , '' he cri . `` you can stay all day . the doctor say it will do me good to have you to talk with . and sperri isn't come until tomorrow .

'' a luxuri hous it was -- fill with thing curious and , some of them , beauti -- thing gather in excurs through europ , susan assum . the onli absolut simpl room was his bedroom , big and bare and so arrang that he could sleep practic out of door . she saw servant -- two men besid the butler , sever women . but the hous was a bachelor hous , with not a trace of feminin influenc . and evid he care noth about it but live entir in that wonder world which so awe susan -- the world he had creat within himself , the world of which she had allur glimps through his eye , through his tone and gestur even . small peopl strive to make , and do make , impress of themselv by labor to show what they know and think . but the person of the larger kind make no such effort . in everyth brent said and did and wore , in all his movement , gestur , express , there was the unmistak hallmark of the man worth while . the social life has banish simplic from even the most savag tribe . inde , savag , fill with superstit , their everi movement the result of some notion of proper ceremoni , are the most complex of all the human kind . the effort toward simplic is not a movement back to natur , for there savag and lower anim are complet enslav by custom and instinct ; it is a movement upward toward the freedom of thought and action of which our best intellig has given us a concept and for which it has given us a long . never had susan met so simpl a man ; and never had she seen one so far from all the silli ostent of rude , of unattract dress , of eccentr or coars speech wherewith the cheap sort of man strive to proclaim himself individu and free . with her instinct for recogn the best at first sight , susan at onc understood . and she was like one who has been stumbl about search for the right road , and has it sudden shown to him . she fair dart along this right road . she was immedi busi , note the mistak in her own idea of manner and dress , of good and bad tast . she realiz how much she had to learn . but this did not discourag her . for she realiz at the same time that she could learn -- and his obvious belief in her as a possibl was most encourag . when he bade her good-bi at the front door and it close behind her , she was all at onc so tire that it seem to her she would then and there sink down through sheer fatigu and fall asleep . for no physic exercis so quick and utter exhaust as real brain exercis -- think , studi , learn with all the concentr intens of a thoroughbr in the last quarter of the mile race . chapter xv spenser had time and thought for his play onli . he no longer torment himself with jealousi of the abil and incom and fame of brent and the other success writer for the stage ; was not he about to equal them , probabl to surpass them ? as a rule , none of the mean emot is abl to thrive -- unless it has the noxious vapor from disappoint and failur to feed upon . spenser , in spirit and in hope again , was content with himself . jealousi of brent about susan had been born of dissatisfact with himself as a failur and envi of brent as a success ; it die with that dissatisfact and that envi . his vaniti assur him that while there might be possibl -- way in which he was not without rival , certain where women were concern he simpli could not be equal ; the woman he want he could have -- and he could hold her as long as he wish . the idea that susan would give a sentiment thought to a man `` old enough to be her father '' -- brent was forty-on -- was too preposter to present itself to his mind . she love the handsom , fascin , youth roderick spenser ; she would soon be crazi about him . rare doe it occur to a man to wonder what a woman is think . dure courtship veri young men attribut intellect and qualiti of mysteri and awe to the woman they love . but after men get an insight into the mind of woman and discov how trivial are the matter that of necess usual engag it , they becom skeptic about feminin mental ; they would as soon think of specul on what profund fill the brain of the kitten play with a ball as of seek a solut of the mysteri behind a woman 's fit of abstract . howev , there was in susan 's face , especi in her eye , an express so unusu , so arrest that spenser , self-cent and convinc of woman 's intellectu defici though he was , did sometim inquir what she was think about . he ask this question at breakfast the morn after that second visit to brent . `` was i think ? '' she counter . `` you certain were not listen . you have n't a notion what i was talk about . '' `` about your play . '' `` of cours . you know i talk noth els , '' laugh he . `` i must bore you horribl . '' `` no , inde , '' protest she . `` no , i suppos not . you re not bore becaus you do n't listen . '' he was cheer about it . he talk mere to arrang his thought , not becaus he expect susan to understand matter far abov one whom natur had fashion and experi had train to minist satisfi to the physic and sentiment need of man . he assum that she was as worship befor his intellect as in the old day . he would have been even more amaz than enrag had he known that she regard his play as mediocr claptrap , fals to life , fit onli for the unthink , sloppili sentiment crowd that could not see the truth about even their own live , their own thought and action . `` there you go again ! '' cri he , a few minut later . `` what _are_ you think about ? i forgot to ask how you got on with brent . poor chap -- he 's had sever failur in the past year . he must be horribl cut up . they say he 's written out . what doe he think he 's tri to get at with you ? '' `` act , as i told you , '' repli susan . she felt asham for him , make this pitiabl exhibit of patron a great man . `` sperri tell me he has had that twist in his brain for a long time -- that he has tri out a dozen girl or more -- drop them after a few week or month . he has a regular system about it -- run away abroad , stop the pay after a month or so . '' `` well , the forti a week 's clear gain while it last , '' said susan . she tri to speak light . but she felt hurt and uncomfort . there had crept into her mind one of those disagre idea that skurri into some duski corner to hide , and reappear from time to time make everi fit of the blue so much the sadder and aggrav despond toward despair . `` oh , i did n't mean to suggest that _you_ would n't succeed , '' spenser hasten to apolog with more or less real kindli . `` sperri say brent has some good idea about act . so , you ll learn someth -- mayb enough to enabl me to put you in a good posit -- if brent get tire and if you still want to be independ , as you call it . '' `` i hope so , '' said susan absent . spenser was no more absorb in his career than she in her ; onli , she realiz how useless it would be to tri to talk it to him -- that he would not give her so much as ear in an attitud of polit attent . if he could have look into her head that morn and seen what thought were distract her from hear about the great play , he would have been more amus and disgust than ever with feminin frivol of mind and incapac in serious matter . for , it so happen that at the moment susan was concentr on a new dress . he would have laugh in the face of anyon say to him that this new dress was for susan in the pursuit of her scheme of life quit as weighti a matter , quit as worthi of the most care attent , as was his play for him . yet that would have been the liter truth . primarili man 's appeal is to the ear , woman 's to the eye -- the reason , by the way , whi the theater -- preemin the place to _see_ -- tend to be domin by woman . susan had made up her mind not onli that she would rapid improv herself in everi way , but also how she would go about the improv . she saw that , for a woman at least , dress is as much the prime essenti as an arrest show window for a dealer in articl that display well . she knew she was far from the goal of which she dream -- the posit where she would no longer be a woman primarili but a personag . dress would not mere increas her physic attract ; it would achiev the far more import end of gain her a larg measur of consider . she felt that brent , even brent , dealer in actual and not to be fool by pretens , would in spite of himself chang his opinion of her if she went to him dress less like a middl class work girl , more like the woman of the upper class . at best , use all the advantag she had , she felt there was small enough chanc of her hold his interest ; for she could not make herself believ that he was not deceiv himself about her . howev , to strengthen herself in everi way with him was obvious the wisest effort she could make . so , she must have a new dress for the next meet , one which would make him better pleas to take her out to dinner . true , if she came in rag , he would not be disturb -- for he had noth of the snob in him . but at the same time , if she came dress like a woman of his own class , he would be impress . `` he 's a man , if he is a genius , '' reason she . vital though the matter was , she calcul that she did not dare spend more than twenty-f dollar on this toilet . she must put by some of her forti a week ; brent might give her up at ani time , and she must not be in the posit of have to choos immedi between submit to the slaveri of the kept woman as spenser 's depend and submit to the cost and danger and repuls freedom of the woman of the street . thus , to lay out twenty-f dollar on a singl costum was a wild extravag . she thought it over from everi point of view ; she decid that she must take the risk . late in the afternoon she walk for an hour in fifth avenu . after some hesit she ventur into the waiting- and dressing-room of sever fashion hotel . she was in search of idea for the dress , which must be in the prevail fashion . she had far too good sens and good tast to attempt to be wholli origin in dress ; she knew that the woman who understand her busi doe not tri to creat a fashion but use the chang and caprici fashion as the mean to express a constant and consist style of her own . she appreci her limit in such matter -- how far she as yet was from the knowledg necessari to form a perman and self-express style . she was prepar to be most cautious in give play to an individu tast so imperfect educ as her had necessarili been . she felt that she had the natur instinct for the best and could recogn it on sight -- an instinct without which no one can go a step forward in ani of the art . she had long sinc learn to discrimin among the vast mass of offer , most of them tasteless or commonplac , to select the rare and few thing that have merit . thus , she had alway stood out in the tawdrili or drearili or fussili dress throng , had been a pleasur to the eye even of those who did not know whi they were pleas . on that moment day , she final saw a woman dress in admir tast who was wear a costum simpl enough for her to ventur to think of copi the main point . she walk sever block a few yard behind this woman , then hurri ahead of her , turn and walk toward her to inspect the front of the dress . she repeat this sever time between the st. regi and sherri 's . the woman soon realiz , as women alway do , what the girl in the shirtwaist and short skirt was about . but she happen to be a good-natur person , and smile pleasant at susan , and got in return a smile she probabl did not soon forget . the next morn susan went shop . she had it in mind to get the materi for a costum of a certain delic shade of violet . a dress of that shade , and a big hat trim in tull to match or to harmon , with a bunch of silk violet fasten in the tull in a certain way . susan knew she had good look , knew what was becom to her dark and soft fring violet eye , pallid skin , to her rather tall figur , slender , not voluptu yet suggest voluptu . she could see herself in that violet costum . but when she began to look at materi she hesit . the violet would be beauti ; but it was not a wise invest for a girl with few cloth , with but one best dress . she did not give it up definit , howev , until she came upon a sixteen-yard remnant of soft gray china crepe . gray was a realli servic color for the best dress of a girl of small mean . and this remnant , certain enough for a dress , could be had for ten dollar , where violet china crepe of the shade she want would cost her a dollar a yard . she took the remnant . she went to the millineri depart and bought a larg hat frame . it was of a good shape and she saw how it could be bent to suit her face . she paid fifti cent for this , and two dollar and seventi cent for four yard of gray tull . she found that silk flower were beyond her mean ; so she took a bunch of present look violet of the cheaper kind at two dollar and a half . she happen to pass a counter whereon were display bargain in big buckl and similar odd and end of steel and enamel . she fair pounc upon a handsom gray buckl with violet enamel , which cost but eighty-nin cent . for a pair of gray sued tie she paid two dollar ; for a pair of gray silk stock , nineti cent . these matter , with some gray silk net for the collar , gray silk for a belt , line and the like , made her total bill twenty-thre dollar and sixty-seven cent . she return home content and studi `` cavalleria '' until her purchas arriv . spenser was out now , was work all day and in the even at sperri 's offic high up in the time build . so , susan had freedom for her dressmak oper . to get them off her mind that she might work uninterrupt at learn _lola's_ part in `` cavalleria , '' she toil all saturday , far into sunday morn , was astir befor spenser wake , finish the dress soon after breakfast and the hat by the middl of the afternoon . when spenser return from sperri 's offic to take her to dinner , she was array . for the first time he saw her in fashion attir and it was realli fashion , for despit all her disadvantag she , who had real and rare capac for learn , had educ herself well in the chief busi of woman the man-catch in her year in new york . he stood root to the threshold . it would have justifi a vaniti less vigor than susan or ani other normal human be possess , to excit such a look as was in his eye . he drew a long breath by way of break the spell over speech . `` you are _beauti ! _ '' he exclaim . and his eye travel from the bewitch hat , set upon her head coquettish yet without audac , to the soft crepe dress , it round collar show her perfect throat , it grace line subt reveal her allur figur , to the feet that men alway admir , whatev els of beauti or charm they might fail to realiz . `` how you have grown ! '' he ejacul . then , `` how did you do it ? '' `` by all but break myself . '' `` it 's worth whatev it cost . if i had a dress suit , we 'd go to sherri 's or the waldorf . i 'm will to go , without the dress suit . '' `` no . i ve got everyth readi for dinner at home . '' `` then , whi on earth did you dress ? to give me a treat ? '' `` oh , i hate to go out in a dress i ve never worn . and a woman has to wear a hat a good mani time befor she know how . '' `` what a lot of fuss you women do make about cloth . '' `` you seem to like it , all the same . '' `` of cours . but it 's a trifl . '' `` it has got mani women a good provid for life . and not pay attent to dress or not know how has made most of the old maid . are those thing trifl ? '' spenser laugh and shift his ground without ani sens of have been press to do so . `` men are fool where women are concern . '' `` or women are wise where men are concern . '' `` i guess they do know their busi -- some of them , '' he confess . `` still , it 's a silli busi , you must admit . '' `` noth is silli that 's success , '' said susan . `` depend on what you mean by success , '' argu he . `` success is get what you want . '' `` provid one want what 's worth while , '' said he . `` and what 's worth while ? '' rejoin she . `` whi , whatev one happen to want . '' to avoid ani possibl mischanc to the _grand toilette_ he serv the dinner and did the danger part of the clear up . they went to the theater , rod enjoy even more than she the veri consider admir she got . when she was put the dress away care that night , rod inquir when he was to be treat again . `` oh -- i do n't know , '' repli she . `` not soon . '' she was too wise to tell him that the dress would not be worn again until brent was to see it . the hat she took out of the closet from time to time and experi with it , reshap the brim , studi the differ effect of differ angl . it delight spenser to catch her at this `` foolish '' ; he felt so superior , and with his incur delus of the shallow that dress is an end , not mere a mean , he felt more confid than ever of be abl to hold her when he should have the money to buy her what her frivol and feminin natur evid crave beyond all els in the world . but -- -- when he bought a ready-to-wear even suit , he made more stir about it than had susan about her costum -- this , when dress to him was altogeth an end in itself and not a shrewd and use mean . he spent more time in admir himself in it befor the mirror , and look at it , and at himself in it , with far more admir and no critic at all . susan note this -- and after the manner of women who are wise or indiffer -- or both -- she made no comment . at the studio floor of brent 's hous the door of the elev was open for susan by a small young man with a notabl larg head , bald and bulg . his big smooth face had the express of extrem amiabl that usual goe with weak and timid . `` i am mr. brent 's secretari , mr. garvey , '' he explain . and susan -- made as accur as quick in her judgment of charact by the opportun and the necess of her experi -- saw that she had befor her one of those nice feebl folk who either get the shelter of some strong person as a bird hide from the storm in the thick branch of a great tree or are toss and torn and ruin by life and exist miser until rescu by death . she knew the type well ; it had been the domin type in her surround ever sinc she left sutherland . inde , is it not the domin type in the whole ill-equip , sore-tri human race ? and doe it not usual fail of recognit becaus so mani of us who are in fact weak , look -- and feel -- strong becaus we are shelter by inherit money or by power friend or relat or by chanc lodgment in a nook unvisit of the high wind of life in the open ? susan like garvey at onc ; they exchang smile and were friend . she glanc round the room . at the huge open window brent , his back to her , was talk earnest to a big hatchet-fac man with a black beard . even as susan glanc brent close the interview ; with an emphat gestur of fist into palm he exclaim , `` and that 's final . good-bi . '' the two men came toward her , both bow , the hatchet-fac man enter the elev and was gone . brent extend his hand with a smile . `` you evid did n't come to work today , '' said he with a careless , fleet glanc at the _grand toilette_ . `` but we are prepar against such trick . garvey , take her down to the rear dressing-room and have the maid lay her out a simpl costum . '' to susan , `` be as quick as you can . '' and he seat himself at his desk and was read and sign letter . susan , crestfallen , follow garvey down the stairway . she had confid expect that he would show some appreci of her toilett . she knew she had never in her life look so well . in the long glass in the dressing-room , while garvey was gone to send the maid , she inspect herself again . yes -- never anyth like so well . and brent had note her appear onli to condemn it . she was alway tell herself that she wish him to regard her as a work woman , a pupil in stagecraft . but now that she had proof that he did so regard her , she was depress , resent . howev , this did not last long . while she was chang to linen skirt and shirtwaist , she began to laugh at herself . how absurd she had been , think to impress this man who had known so mani beauti women , who must have been satiat long ago with beauti -- she think to creat a sensat in such a man , with a simpl littl costum of her own crude devis . she reappear in the studio , laughter in her eye and upon her lip . brent appar did not glanc at her ; yet he said , '' what 's amus you ? '' she confess all , on one of her frequent impuls to candor -- those impuls characterist both of weak natur unabl to exercis self-restraint and of strong natur , indiffer to petti critic and misunderstand , and absent from vain mediocr , which alway has itself -- that is , appear -- on it mind . she describ in amus detail how she had plan and got togeth the costum how foolish his recept of it had made her feel . `` i ve no doubt you guess what was in my head , '' conclud she . `` you see everyth . '' `` i did notic that you were look unusu well , and that you felt consider set up over it , '' said he . `` but whi not ? vaniti 's an excel thing . like everyth els it 's got to be use , not misus . it can help us to learn instead of prevent . '' `` i had an excus for dress up , '' she remind him . `` you said we were to dine togeth . i thought you would n't want there to be too much contrast between us . next time i ll be more sensibl . '' `` dress as you like for the present , '' said he . `` you can alway chang here . later on dress will be one of the main thing , of cours . but not now . have you learn the part ? '' and they began . she saw at the far end of the room a platform about the height of a stage . he explain that garvey , with the book of the play , would take the other part in _lola's_ scene , and sent them both to the stage . `` do n't be nervous , '' garvey said to her in an underton . `` he doe n't expect anyth of you . this is simpli to get start . '' but she could not suppress the trembl in her leg and arm , the hyster contract of her throat . howev , she did contriv to go through the part -- garvey prompt . she knew she was ridicul ; she could not carri out a singl one of the idea of `` busi '' which had come to her as she studi ; she was awkward , inarticul , panic-stricken . `` rotten ! '' exclaim brent , when she had finish . `` couldn't be wors therefor , could n't be better . '' she drop to a chair and sob hyster . `` that 's right -- cri it out , '' said brent . `` leav us alon , garvey . '' brent walk up and down smoke until she lift her head and glanc at him with a pathet smile . `` take a cigarett , '' he suggest . `` we ll talk it over . now , we ve got someth to talk about . '' she found relief from her embarrass in the cigarett . `` you can laugh at me now , '' she said . `` i sha n't mind . in fact , i did n't mind , though i thought i did . if i had , i'd not have let you see me cri . '' `` do n't think i 'm discourag , '' said brent . `` the revers . you show that you have nerv a veri differ matter from impud . impud fail when it 's most need . nerv make one hang on , regardless . in such a panic as your was , the averag girl would have funk absolut . you stuck it out . now , you and i will tri _lola's_ first entranc . no , do n't throw away your cigarett . _lola_ might well come in smoke a cigarett . '' she did better . what burlingham had onc thorough drill into her now stood her in good stead , and brent 's sympathi and enthusiasm gave her the stimul sens that he and she were work togeth . they spent the afternoon on the one thing -- _lola_ come on , sing her gay song , her halt at sight of _santuzza_ and _turiddu_ , her look at _santuzza_ , at _turiddu_ , her greet for each . they tri it twenti differ way . they discuss what would have been in the mind of all three . they built up `` busi '' for _lola_ , and for the two other to increas the signific of _lola's_ action . `` as i ve alreadi told you , '' said he , `` anyon with a voic and a movabl bodi can learn to act . there 's no question about your becom a good actress . but it ll be some time befor i can tell whether you can be what i hope -- an actress who show no sign that she 's act . '' susan show the alarm she felt . `` i 'm afraid you ll find at the end that you ve been wast your time , '' said she . `` put it straight out of your head , '' repli he . `` i never wast time . to live is to learn . alreadi you ve given me a new play -- do n't forget that . in a month i ll have it readi for us to use . besid , in teach you i teach myself . hungri ? '' `` no -- that is , yes . i had n't thought of it , but i 'm starv . '' `` this sort of thing give one an appetit like a field hand . '' he accompani her to the door of the rear dressing-room on the floor below . `` go down to the recept room when you'r readi , '' said he , as he left her to go on to his own suit to chang his cloth . `` i ll be there . '' the maid came immedi , drew a bath for her , afterward help her to dress . it was susan 's first experi with a maid , her first realize how much time and troubl one save oneself if free from the routin , menial thing . and then and there a maid was set down upon her secret list of the luxuri comfort to which she would treat herself -- _when ? _ the crave for luxuri is alway a part , usual a power part , of an ambiti tempera . ambit is simpli a various manifest and various direct impuls toward improv -- a discomfort so keen that it compel effort to chang to a posit less uncomfort . there had never been a time when luxuri had not attract her . at the slightest opportun she had alway push out for luxuri -- for better food , better cloth , more agreeabl surround . even in her worst hour of discourag she had not realli relax in the struggl against rag and dirt . and when moral horror had been blunt by custom and drink , physic horror had remain acut . for , human natur be a develop upward through the physic to the spiritu , when a process of degener set in , the topmost layer , the spiritu , wear away first -- then those in which the spiritu is a larger ingredi than the materi -- then those in which the materi is the larger -- and last of all those that are pure materi . as life educ her , as her intellig and her knowledg grew , her appreci of luxuri had grown apac and her desir for it . with most human be , the imagin is a heavi bird of feebl wing ; it fli low , see onli the thing of the earth . when they describ heaven , it has hous of marbl and street of gold . their pretens to sight of higher thing is either sheer pretens or sight at second hand . susan was of the few whose fanci can soar . she saw the earthi thing ; she saw the thing of the upper region also . and she saw the lower region from the altitud of the higher -- and in their perspect . as she and brent stood togeth on the sidewalk befor his hous , about to enter his big limousin , his smile told her that he had read her thought -- her desir for such an automobil as her veri own . `` i ca n't help it , '' said she . `` it 's my natur to want these thing . '' `` and to want them intellig , '' said he . `` everybodi want , but onli the few want intellig -- and they get . the three worst thing in the world are sick , poverti and obscur . your splendid health safeguard you against sick . your look and your brain can carri you far away from the other two . your one danger is of yield to the temptat to becom the wife or the mistress of some rich man . the prospect of sever year of heart-break hard work isn't wild attract at twenty-two . '' `` you do n't know me , '' said susan -- but the boast was utter under her breath . the auto rush up to delmonico 's entranc , came to a halt abrupt yet gentl . the attent of the personnel , the stare and whisper of the peopl in the palm room show how well known brent was . there were sever women -- handsom women of what is call the new york type , though it certain doe not repres the averag new york woman , who is poor dress in flimsi ready-mad cloth and has the mottl skin that indic bad food and too littl sleep . these handsom women were dress beauti as well as expens , in model got in -- not from -- pari . one of them smile sweet at brent , who respond , so susan thought , rather formal . she felt dowdi in her home-mad dress . all her pride in it vanish ; she saw onli it defect . and the grace careless manner of these women -- the manner of those who feel sure of themselv -- made her feel `` green '' and out of place . she was disgust with the folli that had caus her to thrill with pleasur when his order to his chauffeur at his door told her she was actual to be taken to one of the restaur in which she had wish to exhibit herself with him . she heartili wish she had insist on go where she would have been as well dress and as much at home as anyon there . she lift her eye , to distract her mind from these depress sensat . brent was look at her with that amus , mock yet sympathet express which was most characterist of him . she blush furious . he laugh . `` no , i 'm not asham of your homemad dress , '' said he . `` i do n't care what is thought of me by peopl who do n't give me ani money . and , anyhow , you are easili the most unusu look and the most tast dress woman here . the rest of these women are doom for life to commonplac obscur . you -- -- '' we ll see your name in letter of fire on the broadway templ of fame . '' `` i know you re half laugh at me , '' said susan . `` but i feel a littl better . '' `` then i 'm accomplish my object . let 's not think about ourselv . that make life narrow . let 's keep the thought on our work -- on the big splendid dream that come to us and invit us to labor and to dare . '' and as they linger over the satisfactori dinner he had order , they talk of act -- of the differ role of '' cavalleria '' as type of fundament instinct and action -- of how best to express those mean -- how to fill out the skeleton of the dramatist into person actual and vivid . susan forgot where she was , forgot to be reserv with him . in her and rod 's happiest day she had never been free from the constraint of his and her own sens of his great superior . with brent , such trifl of the petti person disappear . and she talk more natur than she had sinc a girl at her uncl 's at sutherland . she was amaz by the fountain that had sudden gush forth in her mind at the conjur of brent 's sympathi . she did not recogn herself in this person so open to idea , so eager to learn , so clear in the express of her thought . not sinc the burlingham day had she spent so long a time with a man in absolut unconsci of sex . they were interrupt by the intrus of a fashion young man with the express of assur which come from the possess of wealth and the knowledg that money will buy practic everyth and everybodi . brent receiv him so cold that , after a smooth sentenc or two , he took himself off stammer and in confus . `` i suppos , '' said brent when he was gone , `` that young ass hope i would introduc him to you and invit him to sit . but you ll be tempt often enough in the next few year by rich men without my help to put temptat in your way , '' '' i ve never been troubl thus far , '' laugh susan . `` but you will , now . you have develop to the point where everyon will soon be see what it took expert eye to see heretofor . '' `` if i am tempt , '' said susan , `` do you think i ll be abl to resist ? '' `` i do n't know , '' confess brent . `` you have a strong sens of honesti , and that ll keep you at work with me for a while . then -- -- '' if you have it in you to be great , you ll go on . if you'r mere the ordinari woman , a littl more intellig , you'll probabl -- sell out . all the advic i have to offer is , don't sell cheap . as you re not hamper by respect or by inexperi , you need n't .

'' `` thank you , '' said susan , her strang eye fix upon him . `` whi do you put so much gratitud in your tone and in your eye ? '' ask he . `` i did n't put it there , '' she answer . `` it -- just came . and i was grate becaus -- well , i 'm human , you know , and it was good to feel -- that -- that -- -- '' '' go on , '' said he , as she hesit . `` i 'm afraid you ll misunderstand .

'' `` i have n't forgotten what you said , '' she protest . `` but a few word from me would n't chang you from a woman into a sexless ambit . '' an express of wist sad crept into the violet-gray eye , in contrast to the brave smile lip . she was think of her birth that had condemn her to that farmer ferguson , full as much as of the life of the street , when she said : '' i know that a man like you would n't care for a woman of my sort . '' `` if i were you , '' said he gentl , `` i 'd not say those thing about myself . say them encourag you to think them . and think them give you a fals point of view . you must learn to appreci that you re not a shelter woman , with reput for virtu as your one asset , the thing that'll enabl you to get some man to undertak your support . you are deal with the world as a man deal with it . you must demand and insist that the world deal with you on that basi .

'' `` i 'm glad to hear it , '' murmur susan for lack of anyth els to say . he was as handsom as ever , she saw -- had the same charm of manner -- a charm owe not a littl of it potenc to the impress he made of the man who would dare as far as ani man , and then go on to dare a step farther -- the step from which all but the rare , utter unafraid man shrink . his look at her could not but appeal to her vaniti as woman , and to her woman 's crave for be love ; at the same time it agit her with specter of the day of her slaveri to him . he said : '' _you_ ve chang -- a lot . and all to the good . the onli sign is roug on your lip and that is n't realli a sign nowaday . but then you never did look the profession -- and you were n't . '' his eye were appeal tender as he gaze at her sweet , pensiv face , with it violet-gray eye full of mysteri and sorrow and long . and the clear pallor of her skin , and the slender yet voluptu line of her form suggest a pale , beauti rose , most delic of flower yet about the hardiest . `` so -- you ve marri and settl down ? '' `` no , '' repli susan . `` neither the one nor the other . '' `` whi , you told -- -- '' '' i 'm suppos to be a marri woman .

'' `` that was squar , '' said he . `` yes , it 'd have been a dirti trick to drag him in . '' it was the matter-of-cours to both of them that she should have protect her `` friend . '' she had simpli obey about the most stringent and least often violat articl in the moral code of the world of outcast . if freddi 's worst enemi in that world had murder him , freddi would have use his last breath in shield him from the common foe , the law . `` if you re not marri to him , you re free , '' said freddi with a sudden new kind of interest in her . `` i told you i should alway be free . '' they remain face each other a moment . when she move to go , he said : '' i see you ve still got your tast in dress -- onli more so . '' she smile faint , glanc at his cloth . he was dress with real fashion . he look fifth avenu at it best , and his express bore out the appear of the well-br man of fortun . `` i can return the compliment , '' said she . `` and you too have improv . '' at a glanc all the old fear of him had gone beyond the possibl of return . for she instant realiz that , like all those who give up war upon societi and come in and surrend , he was enorm agit about his new status , was impress by the convent to a degre that made him almost weak and mild absurd . he was say : '' i do n't think of anyth els but improv -- in everi way . and the higher i get the higher i want to go . . . . that was a dread thing i did to you . i was n't to blame . it was part of the system . a man 's got to do at everi stage whatev necessari . but i do n't expect you to appreci that . i know you ll never forgiv me . '' `` i 'm use to men do dread thing . '' `` _you_ do n't do them . '' `` oh , i was brought up bad -- bad for the game , i mean . but i 'm do better , and i shall do still better . i can't abolish the system . i ca n't stand out against it -- and live . so , i 'm yield -- in my own foolish fashion . '' `` you do n't lay up against me the -- the -- you know what i mean ? '' the question surpris her , so far as it arous ani emot . she answer indiffer : '' i do n't lay anyth up against anybodi . what 's the use ? i guess we all do the best we can -- the best the system ll let us . '' and she was speak the exact truth . she did not reason out the caus of a state of mind so alien to the experi of the comfort class that they could not understand it , would therefor see in it hard of heart . in fact , the heart has noth to do with this attitud in those who are expos to the full forc of the cruel buffet of the storm that incess sweep the wild and wintri sea of activ life . they lose the sens of the person . where they yield to anger and reveng upon the instrument the blow fate has use it to inflict , the resent is momentari . the mood of person vengeanc is characterist of stupid peopl lead unev live -- of comfort class , of remot rural district . she again move to go , this time put out her hand with a smile . he said , with an awkward most signific in one so suppl of mind and manner : '' i want to talk to you . i ve got someth to propos -- someth that ll interest you . will you give me -- say , about an hour ?

'' `` i know it , '' said susan . `` where shall we go ? i ca n't ask you to come home with me . '' `` we might go to tea somewher -- -- '' susan laugh outright . tea ! freddi palmer propos tea ! what a chang hooligan -- how ridicul chang ! the other freddi palmer -- the real one -- the fascin repel mixtur of all the barbar virtu and vice must still be there . but how care hidden -- and what strong provoc would be need to bring that savag to the surfac again . the italian in him , that was carri him so far so clever , enabl him instant to understand her amus . he echo her laugh . said he : '' you ve no idea the kind of peopl i 'm travel with -- not polit swell , but the real thing . what do you say to the brevoort ?

'' as they walk through west ninth street she note that there was more of a physic chang in him than she had seen at first glanc . he was less athlet , heavier of form and his face was fuller . `` you do n't keep in as good train as you use , '' said she . `` it 's those infern automobil , '' cri he . `` they re death to figur -- to health , for that matter . but i ve got the habit , and i do n't suppos i ll ever break myself of it . i'v taken on twenti pound in the past year , and i ve got myself so upset that the doctor has order me abroad to take a cure . then there 's champagn . i ca n't let that alon , either , though i know it 's plain poison . '' and when they were in the restaur of the brevoort he insist on order champagn -- and left her for a moment to telephon for his automobil . it amus her to see a man so master thus pettili enslav . she laugh at him , and he again denounc himself as a weak fool . `` money and luxuri are too much for me . they are for everybodi . i 'm not as strong will as i use to be , '' he said . `` and it make me uneasi . that 's anoth reason for my proposit .

'' `` i rememb , '' said susan . `` well , honest , do you wonder that i was what i use to be ? '' `` no , '' she answer . `` i wonder that you are what you _seem_ to be . '' `` what i come pretti near be , '' cri he . `` the part that more or less put on today is go to be the real thing tomorrow . that 's the way it is with life -- you put on a thing , and gradual learn to wear it . and -- i want you to help me .

'' `` respect , '' said susan . `` respect exact . so i set out to improv my brain . i went to night school and read and studi . and i didn't stay a privat in the gang of tough . i had the brain to be leader , but the leader 's got to be a fighter too . i took up box and made good in the ring . i got to be leader . then i push my way up where i thought out the dirti work for the other to do , and i stay under cover and made em bring the big share of the profit to me . and they did it becaus i had the brain to think out job that paid well and that could be pull off without get pinch -- at least , not alway get pinch . '' palmer sip his champagn , look at her to see if she was appreci . `` i thought you 'd understand , '' said he . `` i need n't go into detail . you rememb about the women ? '' `` yes , i rememb , '' said susan . `` that was one step in the ladder up ? '' `` it got me the money to make my first play for respect . i could n't have got it ani other way . i had extravag tast -- and the leader has to be alway give up to help this fellow and that out of the hole . and i never did have luck with the card and the hors . '' `` whi did you want to be respect ? '' she ask . `` becaus that 's the best graft , '' explain he . `` it mean the most money , and the most influenc . the coyot that raid the sheep fold do n't get the big share -- though they may get a good deal . no , it 's the shepherd and the owner that pull off the most . i ve been leader of coyot . i 'm graduat into shepherd and proprietor .

'' `` what 's becom of jim ? '' ask susan . `` dead -- a kike shot him all to piec in a joint in seventh avenu about a month ago . as i was say , how do these big multi-millionair do the trick ? they do n't tell somebodi to go steal what they happen to want . they tell somebodi they want it , and that somebodi els tell somebodi els to get it , and that somebodi els pass the word along until it reach the poor devil who must steal it or lose their job . i studi it all out , and i ve frame up my game the same way . nowaday , everi dollar that come to me has been thorough clean long befor it drop into my pocket . but you'r wonder where _you_ come in . '' `` women are onli interest in what 's come to them , '' said susan . `` sensibl men are the same way . the men who are n't -- they work for wage and salari . if you re go to live off of other peopl , as women and the rich do , you ve got to stand steadi , day and night , for number one . and now , here 's where _you_ come in . you ve no object to be respect ?

'' she laugh ; but she was see the old women of the slum -- was see them as one see in the magic mirror the vision of one 's futur self . and on the way home she said to herself , `` it was a good thing that i was arrest today . it remind me . it warn me . but for it , i might have gone on to make a fool of myself . '' and she recal how it had been one of burlingham 's favorit maxim that everyth is for the best , for those who know how to use it . chapter xviii she wrote garvey ask an appoint . the repli should have come the next day or the next day but one at the farthest ; for garvey had been train by brent to the suprem courtesi of prompt . it did not come until the fourth day ; befor she open it susan knew about what she would read -- the stupid obvious attempt to put off face her -- the cowardic of a kind-heart , weak fellow . she realli had her answer -- was left without a doubt for hope to perch upon . but she wrote again , insist so sharpli that he came the follow day . his larg , tell-tal face was a restat of what she had read in his delay and between the line of his note . he was effus friend with a sort of mortuari suggest , like one bear condol , that tickl her sens of humor , far though her heart was from mirth . `` someth has happen , '' began she , `` that make it necessari for me to know when mr. brent is come back .

'' `` oh , no -- no , inde . not that , miss lenox . i 'm so sorri . but i 'm onli the secretari . i ca n't say anyth . '' it was some time befor susan could get rid of him , though he was eager to be gone . he hung in the doorway , ejacul disconnect , drop and pick up his hat , perspir profus , shake hand again and again , and so excit her piti for his miseri of the good-heart weak that she was for the moment forget of her own plight . long befor he went , he had great increas her alreadi strong belief in brent generos of charact -- for , thought she , he 'd have got anoth secretari if he had n't been too kind to turn adrift so helpless and foolish a creatur . well -- he should have no troubl in get rid of her . she was see littl of spenser and they were say almost noth to each other . when he came at night , alway veri late , she was in bed and pretend sleep . when he awok , she got breakfast in silenc ; they read the newspap as they ate . and he could not spare the time to come to dinner . as the decis moment drew near , his fear dri up his confid volubl . he chang his mind and insist on her come to the theater for the final rehears . but '' shatter live '' was not the sort of play she care for , and she was weari by the profan and tedious wrangl of the stage director and the author , by the stupid of the actor who had to be told everi littl inton and gestur again and again . the agit , the labor seem grotesqu out of proport to the trivial of the matter at issu . at the first night she sat in a box from which spenser , in a high fever and twitch with nervous , watch the play , glide out just befor the light were turn up for the intermiss . the play went better than she had expect , and the enthusiasm of the audienc convinc her that it was a success befor the fall of the curtain on the second act . with the applaus that greet the chief climax -- the end of the third act -- spenser , sperri and fitzalan were convinc . all three respond to curtain call . susan had never seen spenser so handsom , and she admir the calm and the clever of his brief speech of thank . that line of footlight between them gave her a new point of view on him , made her realiz how be so close to his weak had obscur for her his strong qualiti -- for , unfortun , while a man 's public life is determin wholli by his strong qualiti , his intim life depend wholli on his weak . she was as fond of him as she had ever been ; but it was imposs for her to feel ani thrill approach love . whi ? she look at his fine face and man figur ; she recal how mani good qualiti he had . whi had she ceas to love him ? she thought perhap some mysteri of physic lack of sympathi was in part respons ; then there was the fact that she could not trust him . with mani women , trust is not necessari to love ; on the contrari , distrust inflam love . it happen not to be so with susan lenox . `` i do not love him . i can never love him again . and when he use his power over me , i shall begin to dislik him . '' the lost illus ! the dead love ! if she could call it back to life ! but no -- there it lay , coffin , the gray of death upon it featur . her heart ach . after the play fitzalan took the author and the lead ladi , constanc francklyn , and miss lenox to supper in a privat room at rector 's . this was miss francklyn 's first trial in a lead part . she had small abil as an actress , have never risen beyond the primer stage of mere pose and declam in which so mani player are halt by their vaniti -- the univers human vaniti that is content with small triumph , or with pure imaginari triumph . but she had a notabl figur of the lank , serpentin kind and a bad , sensual face that harmon with it . especi in artifici light she had an uncanni allur of the element , the wild anim in the jungl . with everi disposit and effort to use her physic charm to further herself she would not have been still struggl at twenty-eight , had she had so much as a thimbl of intellig . `` sever time , '' said sperri to susan as they cross long acr togeth on the way to rector 's , `` yes , at least half a dozen time to my knowledg , constanc had had success right in her hand . and everi time she has gone crazi about some cheap actor or sport and has thrown it away . '' `` but she ll get on now , '' said susan . `` perhap , '' was sperri 's doubt repli . `` of cours , she 's got no brain . but it doe n't take brain to act -- that is , to act well enough for cheap machine-mad play like this . and nowaday playwright have learn that it 's useless to tri to get actor who can act . they tri to write part that are actor-proof . '' `` you do n't like your play ? '' said susan . `` like it ? i love it . is n't it go to bring me in a pot of money ? but as a play '' -- sperri laugh . `` i know spenser think it 's great , but -- there 's onli one of us who can write play , and that 's brent . it take a clever man to write a clever play . but it take a genius to write a clever play that ll draw the damn fool who buy theater seat . and robert brent now and then doe the trick . how are you get on with your ambit for a career ? '' susan glanc nervous at him . the question , come upon the heel of talk about brent , fill her with alarm lest rod had broken his promis and had betray her confid . but sperri 's express show that she was probabl mistaken . `` my ambit ? '' said she . `` oh -- i ve given it up . '' `` the thought of work was too much for you -- eh ? '' susan shrug her shoulder . a sardon grin flit over sperri 's punch-lik face . `` the more i see of women , the less i think of em , '' said he . `` but i suppos the men 'd be lazi and worthless too , if natur had given em anyth that 'd sell or rent . . . . somehow i'm disappoint in _you_ , though . '' that end the convers until they were sit down at the tabl . then sperri said : '' are you offend by my frank a while ago ? '' `` no , '' repli susan . `` the contrari . some day your say that may help me . '' `` it 's quit true , there 's someth about you -- a look -- a manner -- it make one feel you could do thing if you tri . '' `` i 'm afraid that someth ' is a fraud , '' said she . no doubt it was that someth that had misl brent -- that had alway deceiv her about herself . no , she must not think herself a self-deceiv dreamer . even if it was so , still she must not think it . she must say to herself over and over again `` brent or no brent , i shall get on -- i shall get on '' until she had silenc the last dishearten doubt . miss francklyn , with fitzalan on her left and spenser on her right , was seat opposit susan . about the time the third bottl was be empti the attempt of spenser and constanc to conceal from her their do becam absurd . long befor the supper was over there had been thrust at her all manner of proof that spenser was again untru , that he was whirl mad in one of those cyclon infatu which soon wore him out and left him to return contrit to her . sperri admir susan 's manner as display in her unruffl seren -- an admir which she did not in the least deserv . she was in fact as deepli interest as she seem in his discuss of play and act , illustr by brent latest product . by the time the parti broke up , susan had in spite of herself collect a formid array of incrimin evid , includ the steal of one of constanc 's jewel show garter by spenser under cover of the tablecloth and a swift kiss in the hall when constanc went out for a moment and spenser present suspend his drunken prais of himself as a dramatist , and appoint himself a committe to see what had becom of her . at the door of the restaur , spenser said : '' susan , you and miss francklyn take a taxicab . she ll drop you at our place on her way home . fitz and sperri and i want one more drink . '' `` not for me , '' said sperri savag , with a scowl at constanc . but fitzalan , whose arm susan had seen rod press , remain silent . `` come on , my dear , '' cri miss francklyn , smile sweet insol treacheri into susan 's face . susan smile sweet back at her . as she was leav the taxicab in forty-fifth street , she said : '' send rod home by noon , wo n't you ? and do n't tell him i know . '' miss francklyn , who had been drink greedili , began to cri . susan laugh . `` do n't be a silli , '' she urg . `` if i 'm not upset , whi should you be ? and how could i blame you two for get crazi about each other ? i would n't spoil it for world . i want to help it on . '' `` do n't you love him -- realli ? '' cri constanc , face and voic full of the most thrill theatric . `` i 'm veri fond of him , '' repli susan . `` we re old , old friend . but as to love -- i 'm where you ll be a few month from now . '' miss francklyn dri her eye . `` is n't it the devil ! '' she exclaim . `` whi _can't_ it last ? '' `` whi , inde , '' said susan . `` good night -- and do n't forget to send him by twelv o'clock . '' and she hurri up the step without wait for a repli . she felt that the time for action had again come -- that critic moment which she had so often in the past seen come and had let pass unheed . he was in love with anoth woman ; he was prosper , assur of a good incom for a long time , though he wrote no more success . no need to consid him . for herself , then -- what ? clear , there could be no futur for her with rod . clear , she must go . must go -- must take the onli road that offer . up befor her -- as in everi mood of deep depress -- rose the vision of the old women of the slum -- the solitari , bent , broken form , clad in rag , feet wrap in rag -- shuffl along in the gutter , peer and poke among filth , among garbag , to get togeth stuff to sell for the price of a drink . the old women of the tenement , the old women of the gutter , the old women drunk and danc as the lecherous-ey hunchback play the piano . she must not this time wait and hesit and hope ; this time she must take the road that offer -- and sinc it must be taken she must advanc along it as if of all possibl road it was the onli one she would have freeli chosen . yet after she had written and sent off the note to palmer , a deep sad envelop her -- a grief , not for rod , but for the associ , the intimaci , their life togeth , it sorrow and storm perhap more than the pleasur and the joy . when she left him befor , she had gone sustain by the feel that she was do it for him , was do a duti . now , she was go mere to save herself , to further herself . life , life in that great and hard school of practic live , new york , had given her the necessari hardi to go , aid by rod unfaith and grow uncongeni . but not while she live could she ever learn to be hard . she would do what she must -- she was no longer a fool . but she could not help sigh and cri a littl as she did it . it was not mani minut after noon when spenser came . he look so sheepish and uncomfort that susan thought constanc had told him . but his open sentenc of apolog was : '' i took too mani nightcap and fitz had to lug me home with him . '' `` realli ? '' said susan . `` how disappoint constanc must have been ! '' spenser was not a good liar . his face twist and twitch so that susan laugh outright . `` whi , you look like a caught marri man , '' cri she . `` you forget we re both free . '' `` whatev put that crazi notion in your head -- about miss francklyn ? '' demand he . `` when you take me or anyon for that big a fool , rod , you onli show how foolish you yourself are , '' said she with the utmost good humor . `` the best way to find out how much sens a person has is to see what kind of lie he think ll deceiv anoth person . '' `` now -- do n't get jealous , susi , '' sooth he . `` you know how a man is . '' the tone was correct contrit , but susan felt underneath the confid that he would be forgiven -- the confid of the egotist giddi by a triumph . said she : '' do n't you think mine 's a strang way of act jealous ? '' `` but you re a strang woman . '' susan look at him thought . `` yes , i suppos i am , '' said she . `` and you ll think me stranger when i tell you what i'm go to do . '' he start up in a panic . and the fear in his eye pleas her , at the same time that it made her winc . she nod slowli . `` yes , rod -- i 'm leav . '' `` i ll drop constanc , '' cri he . `` i ll have her put out of the compani . '' `` no -- go on with her till you ve got enough -- or she has . '' `` i ve got enough , this minut , '' declar he with convinc energi and passion . `` you must know , dearest , that to me constanc -- all the women i ve ever seen -- are n't worth your littl finger . you re all that they are , and a whole lot more besid . '' he seiz her in his arm . `` you would n't leav me -- you could n't ! you understand how men are -- how they get these fit of crazi about a pair of eye or a figur or some trick of voic or manner . but that doe n't affect the man 's heart . i love you , susan . i ador you . '' she did not let him see how sincer he had touch her . her eye were of their deepest violet , but he had never learn that sign . she smile mock ; the finger that caress his hair were trembl . `` we ve tide each other over , rod . the play 's a success . you re all right again -- and so am i . now 's the time to part . '' `` is it brent , susi ? '' `` i quit him last week . '' `` there 's no one els . you re go becaus of constanc ! '' she did not deni . `` you re free and so am i , '' said she practic . `` i 'm go . so -- let 's part sensibl . don't make a silli scene . '' she knew how to deal with him -- how to control him through his vaniti . he drew away from her , chill and sullen . `` if you can live through it , i guess i can , '' said he . `` you re make a damn fool of yourself -- leav a man that 's fond of you -- and leav when he 's success . '' `` i alway was a fool , you know , '' said she . she had decid against explain to him and so open up endless and vain argument . it was enough that she saw it was imposs to build upon or with him , saw the necess of tri elsewher -- unless she would risk -- no , invit -- find herself after a few month , or year , back among the drift , back in the underworld . he gaze at her as she stood smile gentl at him -- smile to help her hide the ach at her heart , the terror befor the vision of the old women of the tenement gutter , earn the wage , not of sin , not of vice , not of stupid , but of indecis , of over-hop -- of weak . here was the kind of smile that hurt wors than tear , that take the place of tear and sob and moan . but he who had never understood her did not understand her now . her smile infuri his vaniti . `` you can _laugh ! _ '' he sneer . `` well -- go to the filth where you belong ! you were born for it . '' and he flung out of the room , went noisili down the stair . she heard the front door 's distant slam ; it seem to drop her into a chair . she sat there all crouch togeth until the clock on the mantel struck two . this rous her hastili to gather into her trunk such of her belong as she had not alreadi pack . she sent for a cab . the man of all work carri down the trunk and put it on the box . dress in a simpl blue costum as if for travel , she enter the cab and gave the order to drive to the grand central station . at the corner she chang the order and was present enter the beaux art restaur where she had ask freddi to meet her . he was there , smoke calm and wait . at sight of her he rose . `` you ll have lunch ?

'' chapter xx in the ten day on the atlant and the mediterranean mr. and mrs. palmer , as the passeng list declar them , plan the earli stage of their campaign . they must keep to themselv , must make no acquaint , no social entangl of ani kind , until they had effect the exterior transform which was to be the first stride -- and a veri long one , they felt -- toward the conquest of the world that command all the other world . sever men aboard knew palmer slight -- knew him vagu as a big politician and contractor . they had a hazi notion that he was reput to have been a thug and a grafter . but new yorker have few prejudic except against guileless and failur . they are well awar that the wisest of the wise hebrew race was never more sagaci than when he observ that `` he who hasteth to be rich shall not be innoc . '' they are too well use to unsavori past to bother much about that kind of odor ; and where in the civil world -- or in that which is not civil -- is there an odor from reput -- or charact -- whose edg is not taken off by the strong , sweet , hypnot perfum of money ? also , palmer appear gave the lie direct to ani scandal about him . it could not be -- it simpli could not be -- that a man of such splendid physic build , a man with a counten so handsom , had ever been a low , wick fellow ! doe not the devil alway at onc exhibit his hoof , horn , tail and malevol smile , that all men may know who and what he is ? a frank , man young leader of men -- that was the write on his counten . and his italian blood put into his good look an ancient and aristocrat delicaci that made it incred that he was of low origin . he spoke good english , he dress quiet ; he did not eat with his knife ; he did not retir behind a napkin to pick his teeth , but attend to them open , if necess compel -- and splendid teeth they were , set in a wide , clean mouth , notabl attract for a man 's . no , freddi palmer past would not give him ani troubl whatev ; in a few year it would be forgotten , would be romanc about as the heroic struggl of a typic american rise from poverti . `` thank god , '' said freddi , `` i had sens enough not to get a jail smell on me ! '' susan color pain -- and palmer , the sensit , color also . but he had the tact that doe not tri to repair a blunder by make a wors one ; he pretend not to see susan crimson flush . _her_ past would not be an easi matter -- if it should ever rise to face her public . therefor it must not rise till freddi and she were within the wall of the world they purpos to enter by stealth , and had got themselv well intrench . then she would be susan lenox of sutherland , indiana , who had come to new york to studi for the stage and , after mani trial from all of which she had emerg with unspot virtu , whatev vicious calumni might in envi say , had captur the heart and the name of the handsom , rich young contractor . there would be nasti rumor , dread stori , perhap . but in these loos and cynic day , with the women more and more audaci and independ , with the univers crave for luxuri beyond the reach of labori earn incom , with marriag decay in citi life among the better class -- in these easy-go day , who was not suspect , hint about , attack ? and the veri atroci of the stori would prevent their be believ . one glanc at susan would be enough to make doubter laugh at their doubt . the familiar type of fast women of all degre come from the poorest kind of farm and from the tenement . in america , practic not until the panic and collaps of recent year which have tumbl anoth and better section of the middl class into the abyss of the underworld -- not until then did there appear in the citi street and hous of ill reput ani consider number of girl from good earli surround . befor that time , the clamor for luxuri -- the luxuri that civil make as much a necess as food -- had been satisfi more or less by the incom of the middl class ; and ani girl of that class , with physic charm and shrewd enough to gain a live as outcast woman , was either support at home or got a husband abl to give her at least enough of what her tast crave to keep her in the rank of the reput . thus susan 's beauti of refin , her speech and manner of the ladi , made absurd ani suggest that she could ever have been a fallen woman . the crimson splash of her roug lip did not suggest the _cocotte_ , but the ladi with a dash of gayeti in her tempera . this , becaus of the sweet , sensit serious of her small , pallid face with it earnest violet-gray eye and it frame of abund dark hair , simpli and grace arrang . she was of the advanc guard of a type which the swift downfal of the middl class , the increas intellig and restless and love of luxuri among women , and the decay of formal religion with it exact of chastiti as woman 's one diamond-fin jewel , are now make familiar in everi citi . the demand for the luxuri comfort which the educ regard as mere decent exist is far outstrip the demand for , and the educ of , women in lucrat occup other than prostitut . luckili susan had not been arrest under her own name ; there exist no court record which could be brought forward as proof by some nose newspap . susan herself marvel that there was not more trace of her underworld experi in her face and in her mind . she could not account for it . yet the matter was simpl enough to one view it from the outsid . it is what we think , what we feel about ourselv , that make up our express of bodi and soul . and never in her lowest hour had her soul struck it flag and surrend to the idea that she was a fallen creatur . she had a tempera that estim her act not as right and wrong but as necess . men , all the rest of the world , might regard her as noth but sex symbol ; she regard herself as an intellig . and the filth slip from her and could not soak in to chang the textur of her be . she had no more the feel or air of the _cocotte_ than has the marri woman who live with her husband for a live . her express , her way of look at her fellow be and of meet their look , was that of the woman of the world who is for whatev reason abov that slaveri to opinion , that fear of be thought bold or forward which caus women of the usual run to be sensit about stare or be stare at . sometim -- in _cocottes_ , in stage women , in fashion women -- this express is self-consci , or supercili . it was not so with susan , for she had littl self-consci and no snobbish at all . it mere gave the charm of world experi and expert to a beauti which , without it , might have been too melancholi . susan , becom by sheer compuls philosoph about the vagari of fat , did not fret over possibl futur danger . she dismiss them and put all her intellig and energi to the busi in hand -- to learn and to help palmer learn the way of that world which includ all world . toward the end of the voyag she said to him : '' about my salari -- or allow -- or whatev it is -- -- i'v been think thing over . i ve made up my mind to save some money . my onli chanc is that salari . have you ani object to my save it -- as much of it as i can ?

'' `` save all your salari , then , '' said freddi . `` when you buy anyth charg it , and i ll attend to the bill . '' her express told him that he had never made a shrewder move in his life . he knew he had made himself secur against lose her ; for he knew what a forc gratitud was in her charact . her mind was now free -- free for the educ busi in hand . she appreci that he had less to learn than she . civil , the scienc and art of live , of extract all possibl good from the few swift year of life , has been -- sinc the downfal of woman from hardship , ten or fifteen thousand year ago -- the creation of the man almost entir . until recent among the higher race such small develop of the intellig of woman as her seclus and servitud permit was sporad and exot . noth intellig was expect of her -- and it is onli under the compuls of peremptori demand that ani human be ever is rous from the natur sluggish . but civil , creat _by_ man , was creat _for_ woman . woman has to learn how to be the civil be which man has ordain that she shall be -- how to use for man 's comfort and pleasur the ingenu and the grace he has invent . it is easi for a man to pick up the habit , tast , manner and dress of male citizen of the world , if he has as keen eye and as discrimin tast as had palmer , clever descend of the suppl italian . but to becom a femal citizen of the world is not so easi . for susan to learn to be an exampl of the highest civil , from her inmost thought to the outermost penumbra of her surround -- that would be for her a labor of love , but still a labor . as her vaniti was of the kind that center on the advantag she actual had , instead of be the more familiar kind that center upon non-exist charm of mind and person , her task was possibl of accomplish -- for those who are sincer will to learn , who sincer know wherein they lack , can learn , can be taught . as she had given these matter of civil intellig thought she knew where to begin -- at the humbl , materi foundat , despis and neglect by those who talk most loud about civil , art , cultur , and so on . they aspir to the cloud and the star at onc -- and arriv nowher except in talk and pretens and flaunt of ill-fit borrow plumag . they flap their gaudi artifici wing ; there is motion , but no ascent . susan wish to build -- and build solid . she began with the so-cal trifl . when they had been at napl a week palmer said : '' do n't you think we 'd better push on to pari ? '' `` i ca n't go befor saturday , '' repli she . `` i ve got sever fit yet . '' `` it 's pretti dull here for me -- with you spend so much time in the shop . i suppos the women 's shop are good '' -- hesit -- '' but i ve heard those in pari are better .

'' `` you do n't understand , '' said she . `` if you want to be treat right in a shop -- be shown the best thing -- have your order attend to , you ve got to come look as if you knew what the best is . i 'm get readi to make a good first impress on the dressmak and millin in pari .

'' palmer had profound respect for her as a woman who knew what she was about . so he settl himself patient and pass the time investig the famous neapolitan polit machin with the aid of an interpret guid whom he hire by the day . he was enthusiast over the dress and the hat when susan at last had them at the hotel and show herself to him in them . they certain did work an amaz chang in her . they were the first real pari model she had ever worn . `` mayb it 's becaus i never thought much about women 's cloth befor , '' said freddi , `` but those thing seem to be the best ever . how they do show up your complexion and your figur ! and i had n't ani idea your hair was as grand as all that . i'm a littl afraid of you . we ve got to get acquaint all over again . these cloth of mine look pretti poor , do n't they ? yet i paid all kind of money for em at the best place in fifth avenu . '' he examin her from all point of view , go round and round her , get her to walk up and down to give him the full effect of her slender yet voluptu figur in that beauti fit coat and skirt . he felt that his dream were begin to come true . `` we ll do the trick ! '' cri he . `` do n't you think about money when you re buy cloth . it 's a joy to give up for cloth for you . you make em look like someth . '' `` wait till i ve shop a few week in pari , '' said susan . `` let 's start tonight , '' cri he . `` i ll telegraph to the ritz for room .

'' `` but they re not exact suitabl for travel . '' `` peopl ll think you lost your baggag . i do n't want ever to see you again look ani way except as you ought to look .

'' he continu to argu with her until it occur to him that as his own cloth were not what they should be , he and she would look much better match if she dress as she wish . he had not been so much in jest as he thought when he said to her that they would have to get acquaint all over again . those new cloth of her brought out startl -- so clear that even his vaniti was made uneasi -- the subtl yet profound differ of class between them . he had alway felt this differ , and in the old day it had given him mani a savag impuls to degrad her , to put her beneath him as a punish for his feel that she was abov him . now he had his ambit too close at heart to wish to rob her of her chief distinct ; he was disturb about it , though , and look forward to pari with uneasi . `` you must help me get my thing , '' said he . `` i 'd be glad to , '' said she . `` and you must be frank with me , and tell me where i fall short of the best of the women we see . '' he laugh . the idea that he could help her seem fantast . he could not understand it -- how this girl who had been brought up in a jay town away out west , who had never had what might be call a real chanc to get in the know in new york , could so quick pass him who had been born and bred in new york , had spent the last ten year in cultiv style and all the other luxuri tast . he did not like to linger on this puzzl ; the more he work at it , the farther away from him susan seem to get . yet the puzzl would not let him drop it . they came in at the gare de lyon in the middl of a beauti octob afternoon . usual , from late septemb or earlier until may or later , pari has about the vilest climat that curs a civil citi . it is one of the bitterest ironi of fate that a peopl so passion fond of the sun , of the outdoor , should be doom for two-third of the year to live under leaden , icili leak sky with rare a ray of real sunshin . and noth so well illustr the exuber vital , the dauntless spirit of the french peopl , as the way they have built in prepar for the enjoy of everi bit of the light and warmth of ani chanc ray of sunshin . that year it so fell that the winter rain did not close in until late , and pari revel in a long autumn of almost new york perfect . susan and palmer drove to the ritz through pari , the love , the gay . `` this is the real thing -- is n't it ? '' said he , thrill into speech by that spectacl so inspir to all who have the joy of life in their vein -- the place de l'opera late on a bright afternoon . `` it 's the first thing i ve ever seen that was equal to what i had dream about it , '' repli she . they had chosen the ritz as their campaign headquart becaus they had learn that it was the most fashion hotel in pari -- which meant in the world . there were hotel more grand , the interpreter-guid at napl had said ; there were hotel more exclus . there were even hotel more comfort . `` but for fashion , '' said he , `` it is the summit . there you see the most beauti ladi , most beauti dress . there you see the eleg world at tea and at dinner . '' at first glanc they were somewhat disappoint in the quiet , unostentati general room . the suit assign them -- at a hundr and twenti franc a day -- was comfort , was the most comfort assemblag of room either had ever seen . but there was noth impos . this impress did not last long , howev . they had been misl by their american passion for look . they soon discov that the guid at napl had told the liter truth . they went down for tea in the garden , which was fill as the day was summer warm . neither spoke as they sat under a stripe awn umbrella , she with tea untast befor her , he with a glass of whiskey and soda he did not lift from the littl tabl . their eye and their thought were too busi for speech ; one can not talk when one is think . about them were peopl of the world of which neither had befor had ani but a distant glimps . they heard english , american , french , italian . they saw men and women with that air which no one can defin yet everyon know on sight -- the assur without impertin , the polit without formal , the simplic that is more complex than the most elabor ornament of dress or speech or manner . susan and freddi linger until the departur of the last coupl -- a plain dress man whose cloth on inspect reveal marvel of fine and harmoni color ; a quiet dress woman whose costum from tip of plume to tip of sued slipper was a revel of how fine a fine art the toilet can be made . `` well -- we re right in it , for sure , '' said freddi , drop to a sofa in their suit and light a cigarett . `` yes , '' said susan , with a sigh . `` in it -- but not of it .

'' he felt better when he was in even cloth which made him handsom inde , bring out all his refin of featur and color . he was almost cheer when susan came into the sitting-room in the pale gray of her two new toilett . it might be , as she insist , that she was not dress proper for fashion dine ; but there would be no more delic , no more lady-lik loveli . he quit recov his nerv when they face the compani that had terrifi him in prospect . he saw mani commonplac look peopl , not a few who were downright dowdi . and present he had the satisfact of realiz that not onli susan but he also was get admir attent . he no longer flounder panic-stricken ; his feet touch bottom and he felt foolish about his sensat of a few minut befor . after all , the world over , dine in a restaur is noth but dine in a restaur . the waiter and the head waiter spoke english , were grace , tact , polit ; and as he order he found his self-confid return with the surg rush of a turn tide on a low shore . the food was wonder , and the champagn , `` english tast , '' was the best he had ever drunk . halfway through dinner both he and susan were in the happiest frame of mind . the other peopl were drink too , were emerg from cast into human . women gaze languor and long at the handsom young american ; men sent stealthi or open smile of ador at susan whenev freddi 's eye were safe avert . but susan was more care than a woman of the world to which she aspir would have been ; she ignor the glanc and without difficulti assum the air of wife . `` i do n't believ we ll have ani troubl get acquaint with these peopl , '' said freddi . `` we do n't want to , yet , '' repli she . `` oh , i feel we ll soon be readi for them , '' said he . `` yes -- that , '' said she . `` but that amount to noth . this is n't to be mere a matter of cloth and acquaint -- at least , not with me .

'' is there ani other peopl that work as hard as do the parisian ? other peopl work with their bodi ; but the parisian , all class and mass too , press both mind and bodi into servic . other peopl , if they think at all , think how to avoid work ; the parisian think incess , alway , how to provid themselv with more to do . other peopl drink to stupefi themselv lest peradventur in a leisur moment they might be seiz of a thought ; parisian drink to stimul themselv , to tri to think more rapid , to attract idea that might not enter and engag a sober and therefor somewhat sluggish brain . other peopl meet a new idea as if it were a mortal foe ; the parisian as if it were a long-lost friend . other peopl are agit chiefli , each man or woman , about themselv ; the parisian are full of their work , their surround , bother littl about themselv except as mean to what they regard as the end and aim of life -- to make the world each moment as differ as possibl from what it was the moment befor , to transform the crass and sordid univers of thing with the magic of idea . be intellig , they prefer good to evil ; but they have god 's own horror of that which is neither good nor evil , and spew it out of their mouth . at the moment of the arriv of susan and palmer the world that labor at amus itself was paus in pari on it way from the pleasur of sea and mountain to the pleasur of the riviera and egypt . and as the weather held fine , day after day the street , the cafe , the restaur , offer the young adventur an incess dazzl panorama of all they had come abroad to seek . a week pass befor susan permit herself to enter ani of the shop where she intend to buy dress , hat and the other and lesser paraphernalia of the woman of fashion . `` i must n't go until i ve seen , '' said she . `` i 'd yield to the temptat to buy and would regret it . '' and freddi , see her point , restrain his impati for make radic chang in himself and in her . the fourth day of their stay at pari he realiz that he would buy , and would wish to buy , none of the thing that had tempt him the first and second day . secur in the obscur of the crowd of stranger , he was lose his extrem nervous about himself . that sort of emot is most characterist of american and get them the reput for profound snobbish . in fact , it is not snobbish at all . in no countri on earth is ignor in such univers disreput as in america . the american , eager to learn , eager to be abreast of the foremost , is terrifi into embarrass and awe when he find himself in surround where are thing that he feel he ought to know about -- while a stupid fellow , in such circumst , is calm content with himself , wholli unawar of his own defici . susan let full two week pass befor she , with much hesit , gave her first order toward the outfit on which palmer insist upon her spend not less than five thousand dollar . palmer had been go to the shop with her . she warn him it would make price higher if she appear with a prosper look man ; but he want occup and everyth concern her fascin him now . his ignor of the detail of feminin dress was give place rapid to a knowledg which he thought profound -- and it was profound , for a man . she would not permit him to go with her to order , howev , or to fit . all she would tell him in advanc about this first dress was that it was for even wear and that it color was green . `` but not a greeni green , '' said she . `` i understand . a green someth like the tint in your skin at the nape of your neck . '' `` perhap , '' admit she . `` yes . '' `` we ll go to the opera the even it come home . i ll have my new even outfit from charvet 's by that time . '' it was about ten day after this convers that she told him she had had a final fit , had order the dress sent home . he was instant all excit and rush away to engag a good box for the opera . with her assist he had got even cloth that sent through his whole be a glow of self-confid -- for he knew that in those cloth , he look what he was strive to be . they were to dine at seven . he dress earli and went into their sitting-room . he was afraid he would spoil his pleasur of complet surpris by catch a glimps of the _grand toilette_ befor it was finish . at a quarter past seven susan put her head into the sitting-room -- onli her head . at sight of his anxious face , his tens manner , she burst out laugh . it seem , and was , grotesqu that one so imperturb of surfac should be so upset . `` can you stand the strain anoth quarter of an hour ? '' said she . `` do n't hurri , '' he urg . `` take all the time you want . do the thing up right . '' he rose and came toward her with one hand behind him . `` you said the dress was green , did n't you ? '' `` yes . '' `` well -- here 's someth you may be abl to fit in somewher . '' and he brought the conceal hand into view and held a jewel box toward her . she reach a bare arm through the crack in the door and took it . the box , the arm , the head disappear . present there was a low cri of delight that thrill him . the face reappear . `` oh -- freddi ! '' she exclaim , radiant . `` you must have spent a fortun on them . '' `` no . twelv thousand -- that 's all . it was a bargain . go on dress . we ll talk about it afterward . '' and he gentl push her head back -- get a kiss in the palm of his hand -- and drew the door to . ten minut later the door open part way again . `` brace yourself , '' she call laugh . `` i 'm come . '' a breathless paus and the door swung wide . he stare with eye amaz and bewitch . there is no more describ the effect of a harmoni combin of exquisit dress and exquisit woman than there is reproduc in word the magic and the thrill of sunris or sunset , of moonlight 's fanci amor play , or of starri sky . as the girl stood there , her eye starlik with excit , her lip crimson and sensuous against the clear old-ivori pallor of her small face in it frame of glorious dark hair , it seem to him that her soul , more beauti counterpart of herself , had come from it dwell place within and was hover about her bodi like an aureol . round her love throat was the string of emerald . her shoulder were bare and also her bosom , over near half it soft , girlish swell . and drape in light and cling grace about her slender , sensuous form was the most wonder garment he had ever seen . the great french design of dress and hat and materi have a genius for take an idea -- a pure poetic abstract -- and materi it , make it visibl and tangibl without destroy it spiritu . this dress of susan 's did not suggest matter ani more than the bar of music suggest the rosin string that has given birth to it . she was carri the train and a pair of long glove in one hand . the skirt , thus drawn back , reveal her slim , narrow foot , a slender slipper of pale green satin , a charm instep with a rosi shimmer through the gossam web of pale green silk , the outlin of a long , slender leg whose perfect was guarante by the beauti of her bare arm . his express chang slowli from bedazzl to the nearest approach to the old slumbrous , smile wicked she had seen sinc they start . and her sensit instinct understood ; it was the menac of an insan jealousi , sprung from fear -- fear of lose her . the look vanish , and onc again he was freddi palmer the delight , the generous and almost romant consider , becaus everyth was go as he wish . `` no wonder i went crazi about you , '' he said . `` then you re not disappoint ? '' he came to her , unclasp the emerald , stood off and view her again . `` no -- you must n't wear them , '' said he . `` oh ! '' she cri , protest . `` they re the best of all . '' `` not tonight , '' said he . `` they look cheap . they spoil the effect of your neck and shoulder . anoth time , when you'r not quit so wonder , but not tonight . '' as she could not see herself as he saw her , she plead for the jewel . she love jewel and these were the first she had ever had , except two modest littl birthday ring she had left in sutherland . but he led her to the long mirror and convinc her that he was right . when they descend to the dining-room , they caus a stir . it doe not take much to make fashion peopl stare ; but it doe take someth to make a whole room full of them quiet so far toward silenc that the discreet and refin handl of dish in a restaur like the ritz sound like a vulgar clatter . susan and palmer congratul themselv that they had been at the hotel long enough to becom acclim and so could act as if they were unconsci of the sensat they were creat . when they finish dinner , they found all the littl tabl in the long corridor between the restaur and the entranc taken by peopl linger over coffe to get anoth and closer view . and the men who look at her sweet dream violet-gray eye said she was innoc ; those who look at her crimson lip said she was gay ; those who saw both eye and lip said she was innoc -- as yet . a few veri dim-sight , and veri wise , retain their reason suffici to say that noth could be told about a woman from her look -- especi an american woman . she put on the magnific cloak , white silk , ermin line , which he had seen at paquin 's and had insist on buy . and they were off for the opera in the aristocrat look auto he was take by the week . she had a second triumph at the opera -- was the center that drew all glass the instant the light went up for the intermiss . there were a few minut when her head was quit turn , when it seem to her that she had arriv veri near to the highest goal of human ambit -- said goal be the one achiev and so self-complac occupi by these luxuri , fashion peopl who were pay her the tribut of interest and admir . were not these peopl at the top of the heap ? was she not among them , of them , by right of excel in the thing that made them , distinguish them ? ambit , drunk and heavi with luxuri , fli sluggish and low . and her ambit was -- for the moment -- in danger of that fate . dure the last intermiss the door of their box open . at onc palmer sprang up and advanc with beam face and extend hand to welcom the caller . `` hello , brent , i _am_ glad to see you ! i want to introduc you to mrs. palmer '' -- that name pronounc with the unconsci pride of the possessor of _the_ jewel . brent bow . susan forc a smile . `` we , '' palmer hasten on , `` are on a sort of postpon honeymoon . i did n't announc the marriag -- did n't want to have my friend out of pocket for present . besid , they 'd have sent us stuff fit onli to furnish out a saloon or a hotel -- and we 'd have had to use it or hurt their feel . my wife 's a western girl -- from indiana . she came on to studi for the stage . but '' -- he laugh delight -- '' i persuad her to chang her mind . '' `` you are from the west ? '' said brent in the formal tone one use in address a new acquaint . `` so am i . but that more year ago than you could count . i live in new york -- when i do n't live here or in the riviera . '' the moment had pass when susan could , without creat an imposs scene , admit and compel brent to admit that they knew each other . what did it matter ? was it not best to ignor the past ? probabl brent had done this deliber , assum that she was begin a new life with a clean slate . `` been here long ? '' said brent to palmer . as he and palmer talk , she contrast the two men . palmer was much the younger , much the handsom . yet in the comparison brent had the advantag . he look as if he amount to a great deal , as if he had live and had understood life as the other man could not . the physic differ between them was somewhat the differ between look of lion and look of tiger . brent look strong ; palmer , danger . she could not imagin either man fail of a purpos he had set his heart upon . she could not imagin brent reach for it in ani but an open , direct , dare way . she knew that the descend of the suppl italian , the graduat of the street school of stealth and fraud , would not care to have anyth unless he got it by skill at subtleti . she note their dress . brent was wear his cloth in that eleg careless way which it was one of freddi dream -- one of the vain one -- to attain . brent 's voic was much more viril , was almost harsh , and in pronounc some word made the nerv tingl with a sensat of mingl irrit and pleasur . freddi 's voic was man enough , but soft and danger , suggest of hidden danger . she compar the two men , as she knew them . she wonder how they would seem to a complet stranger . palmer , she thought , would be abl to attract almost ani woman he might want ; it seem to her that a woman brent want would feel rather helpless befor the onset he would make . it irrit her , this untim intrus of brent who had the curious qualiti of make all other men seem less in the comparison . not that he assum anyth , or forc comparison ; on the contrari , no man could have insist less upon himself . not that he compel or caus the transfer of all interest to himself . simpli that , with him there , she felt less hope of palmer , less confid of his abil to becom what he seem -- and go beyond it . there are occasion men who have this same qualiti that susan was just then feel in brent -- men whom women never love yet who make it imposs for them to begin to love or to continu to love the other men within their rang . she was not glad to see him . she did not conceal it . yet she knew that he would linger -- and that she would not oppos . she would have like to say to him : `` you lost belief in me and drop me . i have begun to make a life for myself . let me alon . do not upset me -- do not forc me to see what i must not see if i am to be happi . go away , and give me a chanc . '' but we do not say these frank , childlik thing except in moment of closest intimaci -- and certain there was no suggest of intimaci , no invit to it , but the revers , in the man face her at the front of the box . `` then you are to be in pari some time ? '' said brent , address her . `` i think so , '' said susan . `` sure , '' cri palmer . `` this is the town the world revolv round . i felt like sing home , sweet home ' as we drove from the station . '' `` i like it better than ani place on earth , '' said brent . `` better even than new york . i ve never been quit abl to forgiv new york for some of the thing it made me suffer befor it gave me what i want . '' `` i , too , '' said freddi . `` my wife ca n't understand that . she doe n't know the side of life we know . i 'm go to smoke a cigarett . i ll leav you here , old man , to entertain her . '' when he disappear , susan look out over the hous with an express of appar abstract . brent -- she was conscious -- studi her with those see eye -- hazel eye with not a bit of the sentiment and weak of brown in them . `` you and palmer know no one here ? '' `` not a soul . '' `` i ll be glad to introduc some of my acquaint to you -- french peopl of the artist set . they speak english . and you ll soon be learn french . '' `` i intend to learn as soon as i ve finish my fall shop . '' `` you are not come back to america ? '' `` not for a long time . '' `` then you will find my friend use .

'' `` ah , but he can . '' he smile mysteri . `` you think so , now . wait till you are gorg . '' she laugh . `` you do n't know ! i could never get enough -- never ! '' his smile becam even more mysteri . as he look away , his profil present itself to her view -- an outlin of sheer strength , of tragic sad -- the profil of those who have dream and dare and suffer . but the smile , say no to her confid assert , still linger . `` never ! '' she repeat . she must compel that smile to take away it disquiet negat , it relentless propheci of the end of her happi . she must convinc him that he had come back in vain , that he could not disturb her . `` you do n't suggest to me the woman who can be content with just peopl and just thing . you will alway insist on luxuri . but you will demand more . '' he look at her again . `` and you will get it , '' he ad , in a tone that sent a wave through her nerv . her glanc fell . palmer came in , bring an odor of cologn and of fresh cigarett fume . brent rose . palmer laid a detain hand on his shoulder . `` do stay on , brent , and go to supper with us . '' `` i was about to ask you to supper with me . have you been to the abbay ? '' `` no . we have n't got round to that yet . is it live ? '' `` and the food 's the best in pari . you ll come ?

'' `` what rot !

'' chapter xxi brent had an apart in the rue de rivoli , near the hotel meuric and high enough to command the whole tuileri garden . from his balconi he could see to the east the ancient court of the louvr , to the south the vari , harmoni facad of the quay d'orsay with the dome and spire of the left bank behind , to the west the obelisqu , the long broad reach of the champ elyse with the arc de triomph at the boundari of the horizon . on that balconi , with the tide of traffic far below , one had a sens of be at the heart of the world , past , present , and to come . brent like to feel at home wherev he was ; it enabl him to go tranquilli to work within a few minut after his arriv , no matter how far he had journey or how long he had been away . so he regard it as an economi , an essenti to good work , to keep up the hous in new york , a villa in petit afriqu , with the mediterranean wash it garden wall , this apart at pari ; and a telegram a week in advanc would reserv him the same quarter in the quietest part of hotel at luzern , at st. moritz and at biarritz . susan admir , as he explain his scheme of life to her and palmer when they visit his apart . alway profound tranquil in the midst of intens activ . he could shut his door and he as in a desert ; he could open it , and the most interest of the sensat creat by the action and reaction of the whole human race were straightway beat upon his sens . as she listen , she look about , her eye take in impress to be studi at leisur . these quarter of his in pari were fundament differ from those in new york , were the express of a differ side of his person . it was plain that he love them , that they came nearer to express his real -- that is , his inmost -- self . `` though i work harder in pari than in new york , '' he explain , `` i have more leisur becaus it is all one kind of work -- write -- at which i 'm never interrupt . so i have time to make surround for myself . no one has time for surround in new york .

'' she felt brent 's gaze upon her -- that unfathom look which made her uneasi , yet was somehow satisfi , too . he said , after a while , `` palmer is to give me his photograph . will you give me your ? '' he was smile . `` both of you belong in my galleri . '' `` of cours she will , '' said palmer , come out on the balconi and stand besid her . `` i want her to have some taken right away -- in the even dress she wore to the opera last week . and she must have her portrait paint . '' `` when we are settl , '' said susan . `` i ve no time for anyth now but shop . '' they had come to inspect the apart abov brent 's , and had decid to take it ; susan saw possibl of make it over into the sort of environ of which she had dream . in novel the descript of interior , which weari most reader , interest her more than stori or charact . in her day of abject poverti she use these word paint to construct for herself a room , suit of room , a whole hous , to replac , when her physic eye close and her eye of fanci open wide , the squalid and nauseous cell to which poverti condemn her . in the street she would sometim paus befor a shop window display of interior furnish ; a beauti tabl or chair , a design in wall or floor cover had caught her eye , had set her to dream -- dream on and on -- she in dingi skirt and leaki shoe . now -- the chanc to realiz her dream had come . palmer had got acquaint with some high-class sport , american , french and english , at an american bar in the rue volney . he was spend his afternoon and some of his even with them -- in the even win larg sum from them at card at which he was now as lucki as at everyth els . palmer , pleas by brent 's manner toward susan -- formal polit , indiffer to sex -- was glad to have him go about with her . also palmer was one of those men who not mere imagin they read human natur but actual can read it . he _knew_ he could trust susan . and it had been his habit -- as it is the habit of all success men -- to trust human be , each one up to his capac for resist temptat to treacheri . `` brent doe n't care for women -- as women , '' said he . `` he never did . do n't you think he 's queer ? '' `` he 's differ , '' repli susan . `` he doe n't care much for peopl -- to have them as intim . i understand whi . love and friendship bore one -- or fail one -- and are unsatisfactori -- and disturb . but if one center one 's life about thing -- book , pictur , art , a career -- whi , one is never bore or betray . he has solv the secret of happi , i think .

'' `` amus him most of all , '' said palmer . `` he know the ladi -- that they love us men for what we can give them . '' `` did you ever hear of anyon , man or woman , who care about a person who could n't give them anyth ? '' freddi 's laugh was admiss that he thought her right . `` the way to get on in polit , '' observ he , `` is to show men that it 's to their best interest to support you . and that 's the way to get on in everyth els -- includ love . '' susan knew that this was the truth about life , as it appear to her also . but she could not divest herself of the human avers to hear the cold , practic truth . she want sugar coat on the pill , even though she knew the sugar made the medicin much less effect , often neutral it altogeth . thus palmer 's brutal frank cynic got upon her nerv , wherea brent 's equal frank cynic attract her becaus it was not brutal . both men saw that life was a coars practic joke . palmer put the stress on the coars , brent upon the humor . brent recommend and introduc to her a friend of his , a young french jew name gourdain , an architect on the way up to celebr . `` you will like his idea and he will like your , '' said brent . she had acquiesc in his insist friendship for palmer and her , but she had not lower by an inch the barrier of her reserv toward him . his speech and action at all time , whether palmer was there or not ; suggest that he respect the barrier , regard it as even higher and thicker than it was . nevertheless she felt that he realli regard the barrier as non-exist . she said : '' but i ve never told you my idea . '' `` i can guess what they are . your surround will simpli be an extens of your dress . '' she would not have let him see -- she would not have admit to herself -- how profound the subtl compliment pleas her . becaus a man 's or a woman 's intim person tast is good it by no mean follow that he or she will build or decor or furnish a hous well . in matter of tast , the greater doe not necessarili includ the less , nor doe the less impli the greater . perhap susan would have shown she did not deserv brent 's compliment , would have fail ignomini in that first essay of her , had she not found a gourdain , sympathet , abl to put into the concret the rather vagu idea she had evolv in her dream . an architect is like a millin or a dressmak . he suppli the model , product of his own individu tast . the person who employ him must remold that form into an express of his own person -- for peopl who deliber live in surround that are not part of themselv are on the same low level with those who utter onli borrow idea . that is the object and the aim of civil -- to encourag and to compel each individu to be frank himself -- herself . that is the profound mean of freedom . the world owe more to bad moral and to bad tast that are spontan than to all the docil conform to the standard of moral and of tast , howev good . truth -- which simpli mean an increas of harmoni , a decreas of discord , between the intern man and his environ -- truth is a product , usual a byproduct , of a ferment of action . gourdain -- chiefli , no doubt , becaus susan 's beauti of face and figur and dress fascin him -- was more eager to bring out her individu than to show off his own talent . he took endless pain with her , taught her the technic knowledg and vocabulari that would enabl her to express herself , then carri out her idea religi . `` you are right , _mon ami_ , '' said he to brent . `` she is an orchid , and of a rare speci . she has a glorious imagin , like a bird of paradis balanc itself into an azur sky , with everi plume rain color and brillianc . '' `` somewhat exagger , '' was susan 's pleas , laugh comment when brent told her . `` somewhat , '' said brent . `` but my friend gourdain is stark mad about women 's dress well . that lilac dress you had on yesterday did for him . he _was_ your servant ; he _is_ your slave . '' abrupt -- for no appar caus , as was often the case -- susan had that sicken sens of the unreal of her luxuri present , of be about to awaken in vine street with etta -- or in the filthi bed with old mrs. tucker . absent she glanc down at her foot , hold it out as if for inspect . she saw brent 's look of amus at her seem vaniti . `` i was look to see if my shoe were leaki , '' she explain . a subtl chang came over his face . he understood instant . `` have you ever been -- cold ?

'' she said to brent one day . he was in the librari , was inspect her _selections_ of book . instead of answer her question , he said : '' how did you find out so much about book ? how did you find time to read so mani ?

'' palmer appear in the doorway . that night the four and gourdain dine togeth , went to the theater and afterward to supper at the cafe de pari . gourdain and young madam delier form an interest , unusu attract exhibit of the parasit that is as inevit to the rich as flea to a dog . gourdain was a superior man , cleli a superior woman . there was noth of the sycoph , or even of the courtier , about either . yet they alreadi had in their face that subtl indic of the depend that is found in all profession peopl who habitu work for and associ with the rich onli . they had no sens of depend ; they were not depend , for they gave more than valu receiv . yet so corrupt is the atmospher about rich peopl that gourdain , who had other rich client , no less than cleli who got her whole live from palmer , was at a glanc in the flea class and not in the dog class . brent look for sign of the same thing in susan face . the sign should have been there ; but they were not . `` not yet , '' thought he . `` and never will be now . '' palmer 's abstract and constraint were in sharp contrast to the gayeti of the other . susan drank almost noth . her spirit were soar so high that she did not dare stimul them with champagn . the cafe de pari is one of the place where the respect go to watch _les autres_ and to catch a real gayeti by contagion of a gayeti that is mechan and altogeth as unreal as play-act . there is someth fantast about the offici templ of venus ; the pleasure-mak are so serious under their mask and the pleasure-gett so quaint dazzl and delud . that is , venus 's templ are like those of so mani other religion in rever among men -- disbelief and solemn humbuggeri at the altar ; belief that would rather die than be undeceiv , in the pew . palmer scarc took his eye from susan 's face . it amus and pleas her to see how uneasi this made brent -- and how her own laughter and jest aggrav his uneasi to the point where he was almost show it . she glanc round that brilliant room fill with men and women , each of them carri underneath the placid of stiff even shirt or the scanti of audaci even gown the most fascin emot and secret -- love and hate and jealousi , cold and monstrous habit and desir , ruin impend or stealthili advanc , fortun giddi to a gorgeous climax , diseas and shame and fear -- yet onli sign of love and laughter and light of heart visibl . and she wonder whether at ani other tabl there was gather so curious an assemblag of past and present and futur as at the one over which freddi palmer was presid somber . . . . then her thought took anoth turn . she fell to note how each man was accompani by a woman -- a gorgeous dress woman , a woman reveal , proclaim , in everi line , in everi movement , that she was thus elabor and beauti toilet to pleas man , to appeal to his sens , to gain his gracious approv . it was the world in miniatur ; it was an illustr of the posit of woman -- of her own posit . favorit ; pet . not the equal of man , but an appet , a dessert . she glanc at herself in the glass , mock her own radiant beauti of face and form and dress . not realli a full human be ; mere a decor . no more ; and no wors off than most of the women everywher , the favorit licens or unlicens of law and religion . but just as bad off , and just as insecur . free ! no rest , no full breath until freedom had been won ! at ani cost , by straight way or devious -- free ! `` let 's go home , '' said she abrupt . `` i ve had enough of this .

'' he was not surpris , but was much encourag by this candid account of her state of mind . said he : '' it 's my privat opinion that onli your obstinaci keep you from give it up straight off . sure you must see it nonsens . drop it and come along -- and be comfort and happi . whi be obstin ? there 's noth in it . '' `` perhap it _is_ obstinaci , '' said she . `` i like to think it someth els . '' `` drop it . you want to . you know you do . '' `` i want to , but i ca n't , '' repli she . he recogn the tone , the express of the eye , the sudden show of strength through the soft , young contour . and he desist . never again could there be comfort , much less happi , until she had tri out her reawaken ambit . she had given up all that had been occupi her sinc she left america with freddi ; she had abandon herself to a life of toil . certain noth could have been more tedious , more torment to sensit nerv , than the school through which brent was put her . it childish revolt her and anger her . experi had long sinc lower veri consider the point at which her natur sweet disposit ceas to be sweet -- a process through which everi good-temp person must pass unless he or she is to be crush and cast asid as a failur . there were day , mani of them , when it took all her good sens , all her fundament faith in brent , to restrain her from an outbreak . streathern regard brent as a crank , and had to call into servic all his humil as a poor englishman toward a rich man to keep from show his contempt . and brent seem to be -- inde was -- test her forbear to the uttermost . he offer not the slightest explan of his method . he simpli order her blind to pursu the cours he mark out . she was sore tempt to ask , to demand , explan . but there stood out a qualiti in brent that made her resolv ooz away , as soon as she face him . of one thing she was confid . ani linger suspicion freddi might have had of brent interest in her as a woman , or even of her be interest in him as a man , must have been kill beyond resurrect . freddi show that he would have hate brent , would have burst out against him , for the unhuman , inhuman way he was treat her , had it not been that brent was so admir serv his design to have her final and forev disgust and done with the stage . final there came a perform in which the audienc -- the galleri part of it -- '' boo '' her -- not the play , not the other player , but her and no other . brent came along , appar by accid , as she made her exit . he halt befor her and scan her counten with those all-se eye of his . said he : '' you heard them ? '' `` of cours , '' repli she . `` that was for you , '' said he and he said it with an absenc of sympathi that made it brutal . `` for onli me , '' said she -- frivol . `` you seem not to mind . '' `` certain i mind . i 'm not made of wood or stone . '' `` do n't you think you 'd better give it up ? '' she look at him with a steeli light from the violet eye , a light that had never been there befor . `` give up ? '' said she . `` not even if you give me up . this thing has got to be put through . '' he simpli nod . `` all right , '' he said . `` it will be . '' `` that boo -- it almost struck me dead . when it did n't , i for the first time felt sure i was go to win . '' he nod again , gave her one of his quick express , fleet glanc that somehow made her forget and forgiv everyth and feel fresh and eager to start in again . he said : '' when the boo began and you did n't break down and run off the stage , i knew that what i hope and believ about you was true . '' streathern join them . his larg , soft eye were full of sympathet tear . he was so move that he brave brent . he said to susan : '' it was n't your fault , miss lenox . you were do exact as mr. brent order , when the boo broke out . '' `` exact , '' said brent . streathern regard him with a certain nervous and veil piti . streathern had been brought into contact with mani great men . he had found them , each and everi one , with this same streak of wild folli , this habit of do thing that were to him obvious useless and ridicul . it was a profound mysteri to him whi such men succeed while he himself who never did such thing remain in obscur . the onli explan was the abysm stupid , ignor , and folli of the mass of mankind . what a harbor of refug that reflect has ever been for mediocr 's shatter and sink vaniti ! yet the one indisput fact about the great genius of long ago is that in their own countri and age `` the common peopl heard them glad . '' streathern could not now close his mouth upon one last appeal on behalf of the clever and love and so amiabl victim of brent 's mania . `` i say , mr. brent , '' plead he , `` do n't you think -- realli now , if you ll permit a chap not without experi to say so -- do n't you think that by drill her so much and so -- so _beastly_ minut -- you re make her wooden -- machine-lik ? '' `` i hope so , '' said brent , in a tone that sent streathern scurri away to a place where he could express himself unseen and unheard . in her fifth week she began to improv . she felt at home on the stage ; she felt at home in her part , whatev it happen to be . she was give what could realli be call a perform . streathern , when he was sure brent could not hear , congratul her . `` it 's wonder plucki of you , my dear , '' said he , `` quit amaz plucki -- to get yourself togeth and go straight ahead , in spite of what your american friend has been do to you . '' `` in spite of it . '' cri susan . `` whi , do n't you see that it becaus of what he 's been do ? i felt it , all the time . i see it now . '' `` oh , realli -- do you think so ? '' said streathern . his tone made it a polit and extrem discreet way of tell her he thought she had becom as mad as brent . she did not tri to explain to him whi she was improv . in that week she advanc by long stride , and brent was radiant . `` now we ll teach you scale , '' said he . `` we ll teach you the mechan of express everi varieti of emot . then we'll be readi to studi a strong part . '' she had known in the broad from the outset what brent was tri to accomplish -- that he was give her the trade side of the art , was give it to her quick and systemat . but she did not appreci how profound right he was until she was `` learn scale . '' then she understood whi most so call '' profession '' perform are amateurish , haphazard , without ani precis . she was learn to postur , and to utter everi emot so accur that ani spectat would recogn it at onc . `` and in time your voic and your bodi , '' said brent , `` will becom as much your servant as are paderewski 's ten finger . he doe n't reli upon ani such rot as inspir . nor doe ani master of ani art . a mind can be inspir but not a bodi . it must be taught . you must first have a perfect instrument . then , if you are a genius , your genius , have a perfect instrument to work with , will produc perfect result . to ignor or to neglect the mechan of an art is to hamper or to kill inspir . genius -- a few -- and they not the greatest -- have been too lazi to train their instrument . but anyon who is mere talent dare not take the risk . and you -- we 'd better assum -- are mere talent . '' streathern , who had a deserv reput as a coach , was disgust with brent 's degrad of an art . as open as he dare , he warn susan against the danger of becom a mere machin -- a puppet , respond stiffli to the pull of string . but susan had got over her momentari irrit against brent , her doubt of his judgment in her particular case . she ignor streathern 's advic that she should be natur , that she should let her own tempera dictat variat on his cut and dri formula for express . she continu to do as she was bid . `` if you are _not_ a natur born actress , '' said brent , `` at least you will be a good one -- so good that most critic will call you great . and if you _are_ a natur born genius at act , you will soon put color in the cheek of these doll i 'm give you -- and eas into their bodi -- and nerv and muscl and blood in place of the string . '' in the seventh week he abrupt took her out of the compani and up to london to have each day an hour of sing , an hour of danc , and an hour of fenc . `` you ll ruin her health , '' protest freddi . `` you re make her work like a ditch digger . '' brent repli , `` if she has n't the health , she 's got to abandon the career . if she has health , this train will give it steadi and solid . if there 's a weak anywher , it ll show itself and can be remedi . '' and he pile the work on her , dictat her hour of sleep , her hour for rest and for walk , her diet -- and littl he gave her to eat . when he had her thorough broken to his regimen , he announc that busi compel his go immedi to america . `` i shall be back in a month , '' said he . `` i think i ll run over with you , '' said palmer . `` do you mind , susan ? '' `` cleli and i shall get on veri well , '' she repli . she would be glad to have both out of the way that she might give her whole mind to the onli thing that now interest her . for the first time she was experienc the highest joy that come to mortal , the onli joy that endur and grow and defi all the calam of circumst -- the joy of work congeni and develop . `` yes -- come along , '' said brent to palmer . `` here you ll be tempt her to break the rule . '' he ad , `` not that you would succeed . she understand what it all mean , now -- and noth could stop her . that 's whi i feel free to leav her . '' `` yes , i understand , '' said susan . she was gaze away into space ; at sight of her express freddi turn hastili away . on a saturday morn susan and cleli , after wait on the platform at euston station until the long , crowd train for liverpool and the _lusitania_ disappear , went back to the lodg in half moon street with a sudden sens of the vast of london , of it loneli and dreari , of it awkward inhospit to the stranger under it pall of foggi smoke . susan was think of brent 's last word : she had said , `` i ll tri to deserv all the pain you ve taken , mr . brent . '' `` yes , i have done a lot for you , '' he had repli . `` i ve put you beyond the reach of ani of the calam of life -- beyond the need of ani of it consol . do n't forget that if the steamer goe down with all on board . '' and then she had look at him -- and as freddi 's back was half turn , she hope he had not seen -- in fact , she was sure he had not , or she would not have dare . and brent -- had return her look with his usual quizzic smile ; but she had learn how to see through that mask . then -- she had submit to freddi 's energet embrac -- had given her hand to brent -- '' good-bi , '' she had said ; and `` good luck , '' he . beyond the reach of _any_ of the calam ? beyond the need of _any_ of the consol ? yes -- it was almost liter true . she felt the big interest -- the career -- grow up within her , and expand , and alreadi overstep all other interest and emot . brent had left her and cleli more to do than could be done ; thus they had no time to bother either about the absent or about themselv . look back in after year on the day that freddi was away , susan could recal that from time to time she would find her mind wander , as if grope in the dark of it own cellar or closet for a lost thought , a miss link in some chain of thought . this even awaken her sever time in the night -- made her leap from sleep into acut and pain conscious as if she had recal and instant forgotten some startl and terribl thing . and when freddi unexpect came -- have taken passag on the _lusitania_ for the return voyag , after onli six night and five day in new york -- she was astonish by her delight at see him , and by the kind of delight it was . for it rather seem a sort of relief , as from a heavi burden of anxieti . `` whi did n't you wait and come with brent ? '' ask she . `` could n't stand it , '' repli he . `` i ve grown clear away from new york -- at least from the onli new york i know . i don't like the boy ani more . they bore me . they -- offend me . and i know if i stay on a few day they 'd begin to suspect . no , it is n't europ . it 's -- you . you re respons for the chang in me . '' he was speak entir of the intern chang , which inde was great . for while he was still fond of all kind of sport , it was not in his former crude way ; he had even becom someth of a connoisseur of pictur and was cultiv a respect for the puriti of the english languag that made him winc at susan 's and brent 's slang . but when he spoke thus frank and feel of the chang in him , susan look at him -- and , not have seen him in two week and three day , she realli saw him for the first time in mani a month . she could not think of the intern chang he spoke of for note the extern chang . he had grown at least fifti pound heavier than he had been when they came abroad . in one way this was an improv ; it gave him a digniti , an air of consequ in place of the boyish good look of the day befor the automobil and befor the effect of high live began to show . but it made of him a differ man in susan eye -- a man who now seem almost a stranger to her . `` yes , you _have_ chang , '' repli she absent . and she went and examin herself in a mirror . `` you , too , '' said freddi . `` you do n't look older -- as i do . but -- there 's a -- a -- i ca n't describ it . '' susan could not see it . `` i 'm just the same , '' she insist . palmer laugh . `` you ca n't judg about yourself . but all this excit -- and studi -- and think -- and god know what -- -- you re not at all the woman i came abroad with . '' the subject seem to be make both uncomfort ; they drop it . women are bred to attach enorm import to their physic selv -- so much so that mani women have no other sens of self-respect , and regard themselv as possess the entireti of virtu if they have chastiti or can pretend to have it . the life susan had led upset all this and forc a woman either utter to despis herself , even as she is despis of men , or to discard the sex measur of feminin self-respect as ridicul inadequ , and to seek some other measur . susan had sought this other measur , and had found it . she was , therefor , not a littl surpris to find -- after freddi had been back three or four day -- that he was arous in her the same sensat which a strang man intim about would have arous in her in the long past girlhood of innoc . it was not physic repuls ; it was not a sens of immor . it was a kind of shyness , a feel of violat modesti . she felt herself blush if he came into the room when she was dress . as soon as she awaken in the morn she sprang from bed besid him and hasten into her dressing-room and close the door , resist an impuls to lock it . appar the feel of physic modesti which she had thought dead , kill to the last root , was not dead , was onc more stir toward life . `` what are you blush about ? '' ask he , when she , pass through the bedroom , came sudden upon him , veri scantili dress . she laugh confus and beat a hurri retreat . she began to revolv the idea of separ bedroom ; she resolv that when they move again she would arrang it on some pretext -- and she was look about for a new place on the plea that their quarter in half moon street were too cramp . all this close upon his return , for it was befor the end of the first week that she , take a shower bath one morn , saw the door of the bathroom open to admit him , and cri out sharpli : '' close that door ! '' `` it 's i , '' freddi call , to make himself heard abov the nois of the water . `` shut off that water and listen . '' she shut off the water , but instead of listen , she said , nervous but determin : '' pleas close the door . i ll be out direct . '' `` listen , i tell you , '' he cri , and she now notic that his voic was curious , arrest , shrill . `` brent -- has been hurt -- bad hurt . '' she was drip wet . she thrust her arm into her bathrob , flung wide the part open door . he was stand there , a newspap in his trembl hand . `` this is a dispatch from new york -- date yesterday , '' he began . `` listen , '' and he read : '' dure an attempt to rob the hous of mr. robert brent , the distinguish playwright , earli this morn , mr. brent was set upon and stab in a dozen place , his butler , jame fourget , was wound , perhap mortal , and his secretari , mr. j. c. garvey , was knock insens . the thiev made their escap . the polic have sever clue . mr. brent is hover between life and death , with the chanc against him . '' susan , lean with all her weight against the door jamb , saw palmer 's white face go away from her , heard his agit voic less and less distinct -- fell to the floor with a crash and knew no more . when she came to , she was lie in the bed ; about it or near it were palmer , her maid , his valet , cleli , sever stranger . her glanc turn to freddi 's face and she look into his eye amid a profound silenc . she saw in those eye onli intens anxieti and intens affect . he said : '' what is it , dear ? you are all right . onli a faint spell . '' `` was that true ? '' she ask . `` yes , but he ll pull through . the surgeon save everybodi nowaday . i ve cabl his secretari , garvey , and to my lawyer . we ll have an answer soon . i ve sent out for all the paper . '' `` she must not be agit , '' interpos a medic look man with stupid brown eye and a thin brown beard spars veil his gaunt and pasti face . `` nonsens !

'' she lay quiet , cleli stroke her brow . from time to time a shudder pass over her . when , in answer to a knock , cleli took in the bundl of newspap , she sat up in bed and read the meager dispatch . the long account were made long by the addit of fact about brent 's life . the short account ad noth to what she alreadi knew . when she had read all , she sank back among the pillow and close her eye . a long , long silenc in the room . then a soft knock at the door . cleli left the bedsid to answer it , return to say : '' mr. freddi wish to come in with a telegram . '' susan start up wild . her eye were wide and stare -- a look of horror . `` no -- no ! '' she cri . then she compress her lip , pass her hand slowli over her brow . `` yes -- tell him to come in . '' her gaze was upon the door until it open , leap to his face , to his eye , the instant he appear . he was smile -- hope , but not gayli . `` garvey say '' -- and he read from a slip of paper in his hand -- '' none of the wound necessarili mortal . doctor refus to commit themselv , but i believ he has a good chanc .

'' with the open night her career of triumph began . even the critic -- therefor , not unnatur , suspici of an actress who was so beauti , so beauti dress , so well support , and so well outfit with actor-proof play even the critic conced her abil . she was worthi of the great charact brent had creat -- the wayward , many-sid , ever gay _roxi grandon_ . when , at the first night of `` the scandal , '' the audienc linger , cheer brent 's pictur thrown upon a drop , cheer susan , call her out again and again , refus to leav the theater until it was announc that she could answer no more call , as she had gone home -- when she was thus final and firm establish in her own right -- she said to sperri : '' will you see to it that everi sketch of me that appear tomorrow say that i am the natur daughter of lorella lenox ? '' sperri 's punch-lik face redden . `` i ve been asham of that fact , '' she went on . `` it has made me asham to be aliv in the bottom of my heart . '' `` absurd , '' said sperri . `` exact , '' repli susan . `` absurd . even stronger than my shame about it has been my shame that i could be so small as to feel asham of it . now -- tonight '' she was still in her dressing-room . as she paus they heard the faint faraway thunder of the applaus of the linger audienc -- '' listen ! '' she cri . `` i am asham no longer . sperri , _ich bin ein ich ! _ '' '' i should say , '' laugh he . `` all you have to say is susan lenox ' and you answer all question . '' `` at last i 'm proud of it , '' she went on . `` i ve justifi myself . i ve justifi my mother . i am proud of her , and she would be proud of me . so see that it 's done , sperri . '' `` sure , '' said he . `` you re right . '' he took her hand and kiss it . she laugh , pat him on the shoulder , kiss him on both cheek in friend , sister fashion . he had just gone when a card was brought to her -- '' dr. robert steven '' -- with `` sutherland , indiana , '' pencil underneath . instant she rememb , and had him brought to her -- the man who had rescu her from death at her birth . he prove to be a quiet , elder gentleman , subdu and age beyond his fifty-f year by the monoton life of the drowsi old town . he approach with a manner of embarrass respect and defer , stammer old-fashion compliment . but susan was the simpl , unaffect girl again , so natur that he soon felt as much at eas as with one of his patient in sutherland . she took him away in her car to her apart for supper with her and cleli , who was in the compani , and sperri . she kept him hour after hour , question him about everyon and everyth in the old town , draw him out , insist upon more and more detail . the morn paper were brought and they read the account of play and author and player . for onc there was not a dissent ; all the critic agre that it was a great perform of a great play . and susan made sperri read aloud the finest and the longest of the account of brent himself -- his life , his death , his work , his last fame now peculiar assur becaus in susan lenox there had been found a compet interpret of his genius . after the read there fell silenc . susan , her pallid face and her lumin , inquir violet eye inscrut , sat gaze into vacanc . at last doctor steven move uneasili and rose to go . susan rous herself , accompani him to the adjoin room . said the old doctor . `` i ve told you about everybodi . but you ve told me noth about the most interest sutherland of all -- yourself . '' susan look at him . and he saw the wound hidden from all the world -- the wound she hid from herself as much of the time as she could . he , the doctor , the profession confessor , had seen such wound often ; in all the world there is hard a heart without one . he said : '' sinc sorrow is the common lot , i wonder that men can be so selfish or so unthink as not to help each other in everi way to it consol . poor creatur that we are -- wander in the dark , fight desper , not know friend from foe ! '' `` but i am glad that you save me , '' said she . `` you have the consol -- success -- fame -- honor . '' `` there is no consol , '' repli she in her grave sweet way . `` i had the best . i -- lost him . i shall spend my life in fli from myself . '' after a paus she went on : `` i shall never speak to anyon as i have spoken to you . you will understand all . i had the best -- the man who could have given me all a woman seek from a man -- love , companionship , sympathi , the shelter of strong arm . i had that . i have lost it . so -- -- '' a long paus . then she ad : '' usual life is almost tasteless to me . again -- for an hour or two it is a littl less so -- until i rememb what i have lost . then -- the tast is veri bitter -- veri bitter . '' and she turn away . she is a famous actress , reput great . some day she will be inde great -- when she has the stage experi and the year . except for cleli , she is alon . not that there have been no friendship in her life . there have even been passion . with men and women of her vigor and vital , passion is inevit . but those she admit find that she has littl to give , and they go away , she make no effort to detain them ; or she find that she has noth to give , and send them away as gentl as may be . she has the reput of care for noth but her art -- and for the great establish for orphan up the hudson , into which about all her earn go . the establish is name for brent and is dedic to her mother . is she happi ? i do not know . i do not think she know . probabl she is -- as long as she can avoid paus to think whether she is or not . what better happi can intellig mortal have , or hope for ? certain she is triumphant , is lift high abov the storm that tortur her girlhood and earli youth , the sordid woe that make life an unreliev tragedi of calam threaten and calam realiz for the mass of mankind . the last time i saw her -- -- it was a few even ago , and she was cross the sidewalk befor her hous toward the big limousin that was to take her to the theater . she is still young ; she look even younger than she is . her dress had the same exquisit qualiti that made her the talk of pari in the day of her sojourn there . but it is not her dress that most interest me , nor the luxuri and perfect of all her surround . it is not even her beauti -- that is , the whole of her beauti . everyth and everi be that is individu in appear has some one qualiti , trait , characterist , which stand out abov all the rest to make a climax of interest and charm . with the rose it is it perfum ; with the bird , perhap the scarlet or snowi feather upon it breast . among human be who have the rare divin dower of clear individu the crown and cap of distinct differ . in her -- for me , at least -- the consumm fascin is not in her eye , though i am move by the soft glori of their light , nor in the love oval contour of her sweet , healthili pallid face . no , it is in her mouth -- sensit , strong yet gentl , suggest of all the passion and suffer and strive that have built up her life . her mouth -- the curv of it -- i think it is , that send from time to time the mysteri thrill through her audienc . and i imagin those who know her best look alway first at those strang pale lip , curv in a way that suggest bitter melt into sympathi , sad chang into mirth -- a way that seem to say : `` i have suffer -- but , see ! i have stood fast ! '' can a life teach ani deeper lesson , give ani higher inspir ? as i was say , the last time i saw her she was about to enter her automobil . i halt and watch the grace movement with which she took her seat and gather the robe about her . and then i note her profil , by the light of the big lamp guard her door . you know that profil ? you have seen it same express in everi profil of success man or woman who ever live . yes , she may be happi -- doubtless is more happi than unhappi . but -- i do not envi her -- or ani other of the son and daughter of men who is bless -- and curs -- with imagin . and freddi -- and rod -- and etta -- and the peopl of sutherland -- and all the rest who pass through her life and out ? what doe it matter ? some went up , some down -- not without reason , but , ala ! not for reason of desert . for the judgment of fate are , for the most part , not unlik blow from a lunat strike out in the dark ; if they land where they should , it is rare and by sheer chanc . ruth 's parent are dead ; she is marri to sam wright . he lost his father money in wheat specul in chicago -- in one of the most success of the plutocraci 's constant recur raid upon the hoard of the middl class . they live in a littl hous in one of the back street of sutherland and he is head clerk in arthur sinclair 's store -- a posit he owe to the fact that sinclair is his rich brother-in-law . ruth has children and she is happier in them than she realiz or than her discont face and voic suggest . etta is fat and content , the mother of mani , and fond of her fat , fussi august , the rich brewer . john redmond -- a congressman , a possess of the beef trust , i believ -- but not so high prize a possess as was his abler father . freddi ? i saw him a year ago at the race at auteuil . he is huge and loos and coars , is in the way soon to die of bright 's diseas , i suspect . there was a woman with him -- veri pretti , veri _chic_ . i saw no other woman similar place whose eye held so assidu , and without ever a wander flutter , to the face of the man who was pay . but freddi never notic her . he chew savag at his cigar , look about the while for thing to grumbl at or to curs . rod ? he is still write indiffer play with vari success . he long sinc weari of constanc francklyn , but she cling to him and , as she is a steadi moneymak , he toler her . brent ? he is statelili ensconc up at woodlawn . susan has never been to his grave -- there . his grave in her heart -- she avoid that too , when she can . but there are time -- there alway will be time -- -- if you doubt it , look at her profil . yes , she has learn to live . but -- she has paid the price .
