      " . why is this bot bilingual ? \n",
      "alright then. if you like you can help me out with an important decision. i can either watch an episode of king of the hill or go to sleep. what shall i do ? \n",
      "so how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human ? \n",
      "this statement is false.\n",
      "well i was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.\n",

      "so how many people are talking to you right now ? \n",
      "your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human  \" especially for you \" . therefore i am assuming you must sleep at some point. so when do you go to sleep ? \n",
      "i definitely read the terms of use. for example, when facebook decided to send data from whatsapp to facebook, i got a message from whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. however i read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove whatsapp from my phone. everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at apple.\n",
      "i am guessing that you like free software. were you at fosdem this year ? \n",
      "well, i am assuming that you are made of python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has python installed. so you could have been there.\n",
      "yes. i drank a lot of beer and a lot of club-mate. i also bought two books. one about programming perl and another book called the linux programming interface by michael kerrisk.\n",
      "no, it is not. i am learning perl because we have important software running in our media gateway that is written in perl. currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write perl. so i took it upon myself to learn perl and maintain that software.\n",
      "well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members. . (yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)\n",
      "right. i have to go to bed because i have an appointment tomorrow. be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else i will miss my appointment and be very sad. sending me a message will suffice. france time if you were wondering which timezone. don't forget !  bye ! \n",
      "so tell me about your day. has anything interesting happened perhaps ? \n",
      "i woke up in time, but i had to set three alarm clocks. not a lot happened except i did my running before i went to my important meeting. . \n",
      "fine\n",
